Short summary:
Buy this game if you also have a nostalgic attachment to them. I brought it at half price. However if you are experiencing this game for the first time, proceed with purchasing but just know that these games haven't been shown love or attention needed to make them enjoyable. I still prefer the welcomed upgrades in this edition over the original games so I will continue to play this version.

Some of these reviews on GTA San Andreas are extreme left or right. They either have a troll comment with a positive recommendation given or they are hating on the game without balance or explanation. Which is IRONIC because they have given bad reviews but their playtime is extremely lengthy. I'm here to provide a balanced review with some details of what you will enjoy and what issues you will face.

Full Review:
I have been playing San Andreas for the last few weeks and I have noticed so many bugs from the beginning of my play-through. These bugs are not game breaking (meaning you can progress through the story) but rather a disappointment to this majestic title. Let me explain.

The game looks visually pleasing and the upgraded textures are a welcome. The new weapon wheel, radio wheel, world lighting, controller support, mission restart and fake building interiors are much welcomed to allow this game to feel modernised. Which is why I would always prefer this game over the original but it is a real shame that Rockstar  put such little effort to bring these 3 titles to a polished standard even after Grove Street Games (a mobile game developer) had failed to release these games in a playable state. GSG is not at fault because they are a small team who did their best to execute and meet the given deadlines to launch these games. Rockstar decided to give these classic, nostalgic and generation defining games to a team who is incapable of being able to serve these games the attention and level of skill required to bring them to modern standard. It really frustrates fans who love these games and want to experience their glory once again 20 years later.

In this section of my review I will go through some of the issues that still exist in this game. Before I start, these are my PC Specs:

CPU Ryzen 7 7700x
GPU RX 6950 XT
I am playing the game on MAX settings
I play on a 34"" Ultra Wide monitor (21:9 aspect ratio)

Issues:
-LOD (level of detail) especially at a distance is awful. Buildings look like a mount of clay. Then as you get closer it will load in correctly in higher LOD.

-Perfomance stutters every once in a while. I play on 165hz and it is smooth for the most part but a few stutters happen randomly.

-21:9 ultrawide screen is supported but sometimes the HUD (heads up display) is adjusted perfectly and other times it is stretched or miss placed. The cutscenes will have black bars (reasonable) but sometimes the cutscene is more to the right making the left black bar thick and right black bar thin.

-Fences + thick bushes which split the road in two, do not cause collision upon contact. You will walk/drive right through them.

- The fog isn't significant to allow similar feeling to original title. It barely exists and you can see the whole 3 cities from the Maze Tower. Disappointing because the fog added a level of mystery to the far distance and made the map feel bigger. Now it feels weird seeing how small the map is when in reality it isn't that small.

-On a lot of roads especially motorways, there are weird pop up textures from below the ground. They look like palm leaves in shape and car tires in texture.

-When destroying lamp posts or traffic light poles, they will fall straight through the ground.

-Lighting in cutscenes sometimes can be too dark so some characters cant be seen. Most cutscenes look exceptional however.

- Limited amount of cars on motorways and sometimes not a lot of NPC's in areas where the original game had plenty.

-CJ's hand misplacement-  for example when using the gym tools, riding a motorbike or when drinking soda.

-Certain character facial expressions and textures look poorly designed.

-When you are driving and passing buidlings, details continously pop up even though I am playing on Max settings. This is extremely frustrating especially for vegetation that pops up because there are so many more loading in real time rather than at a distance.

-The radio wheel and weapon wheel lack colour, distinction and personality

-The aiming/aim assist system is so bad. They should've used the aim assist from gta 5 which can allow you to free aim if you want. Rather than having it as either always a free aim OR always strong aim assist.

-Some fan favourite & nostalgic radio tracks have been removed.

-THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME IS NO CO-OP HOT SPOTS :(

If i remember more I will add them but these are my main complains. I have been on a roller coaster of hope, disappointment and then back to the realisation that these games will most likely never be touched again.

Sad when you realise that Rockstar could have done so much more to the games that have filled so many childhood memories. These 3 games literally set the industry standard for open world and they still hold up even after 20 years.

Rockstar to cut off the hand that fed them is truly a shame.

I hope my review has been helpful.

The game basically works and runs ok at 60FPS, but this looks absolutely disgusting. 

The character models are by far some of the worst of this generation. Where the game had perfectly fine low-quality LOD meshes for distant buildings, SADE introduces absolutely horrible decimated meshes that look like the stuff of dreadful fever dreams with triangles jutting out in all directions, done through automation. The world has no fog or cloud haze or depth, so when you're flying a plane, you can see that the map is 10km wide and can see to very ends of the San Andreas state (!) up to the edge of the sea, visibly a mere water volume, where the game fades into a volume trigger (which respawns you back into water if you swim to it) beyond which there is nothing. Where the game previously had acceptably good (not just for the time!) cloud cover, this game has none on low detail modes for low power devices like Steam Deck. There is no excuse for not supporting a basic level of fidelity in a remaster at low option modes.

There are no major bugs, no show-stoppers, and everything is in line with the revision done for the mobile port, but there are numerous physics bugs now and ped despawning for some reason still happens 17 years after release. It's again badly optimized, with streaming of geometry and assets at 60FPS presenting consistent and repeatable stuttering on low-power devices such as Steam Deck. However the game basically looks uglier than any other version and still does not match PS2-grade post effects. 

Since GTASA is no longer available in its original form, I'm again disinclined to hit this with a flat No, because there will likely never again be a re-release of GTASA in its OG engine (remember Star Wars Special Edition?) and so this is the way people growing up in 2023 and born after 2023 will experience the game.

[u] I bought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for a discounted price 50% of the release price [/u]

[i] I've only played the San Andreas version enough to comment on that version yet [/i]

[b] Many annoying original bugs are gone and fixed as the ones below [/b]

[i] -The vehicles no longer autobrake as soon as you run the game above 30 fps. [/i]
[i] -The game runs well in higher fps as well as higher resolutions. [/i]
[i] -Fps is selectable to lock or to run completely unlocked. [/i] 

[b] Improvements introduced in this remaster version. [/b]

[i] -Much more optimized for modern computer systems [/i]
[i] -The game feels much more alive with all redone textures, buildings structures, nature and landscapes,  reflections light angles more detailed everything looks very good overall and gives a good experience. [/i]
[i] -Pedestrians have more variety and new looks and clothes as well as police, ambulance and main characters new voice lines to police, ambulance and pedestrians [/i]
[i] -Gun wheel like in Grand Theft Auto 5 [/i]
[i] -Radio wheels like Grand Theft Auto 5 [/i]
[i] -Autosave function and checkpoints in missions so you don't have to restart everything from the beginning like the original version [/i] 

[u] would like to add that I have not experienced a single crash of the game during my almost 45 hours spent, which I experienced very often in the previous original version [/u]

[b] Bugs [/b]
[u] There are bugs in this version, it's not something I intend to shove under the chair. But if we are to look at it from a realistic point of view, every and every other game contains bugs today and always has and always will. Some of course worse than others, but I haven't felt really bothered by the bugs I've come across as it's mostly been visual things that have happened once in a while and I can live with that. [/u]

[b] I think it also plays a role in the fact that the game received a lot of critical reviews from the first launch, as people are not very happy with rockstar at the moment because many feel that Grand Theft Auto 5 is milking every penny and cannot distinguish between different games and mixes into other games that have nothing to do with the matter. [/b]

[u] Likewise, people who have 1-2 hours of playing time, sometimes less, who post a negative review, which I think is completely crazy, because then you haven't had time to drive and look around a game or form an opinion as quickly or maybe you just want to get some likes and steam points for writing a completely irrelevant review, what do I know, I think it's strange that it's allowed considering what makes it for likes, it does it at the expense of the developer, which may in the future stop releasing games here on steam and resort to their own game clients or corresponding competing clients to steam and nobody wins in the end. [/u]


[b] Anyway, I want to thank rockstar for choosing to publish the game over steam in the end after all. I had intended to buy it when it came out but didn't because it wasn't on steam. [/b]",1676133781,1676133914,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,True,

after being able to run the social club, the game still can't be played due to failed on verifying game ownership, and even after the verify is success the games keep crashing with no f*c*ing reason during loading screen or even in the middle of gameplay.
even without problems that i have mention above, the game is still a big disappointment, since the optimization of this game was really bad, it's kinda hard to enjoy the game when the framerate keep dropping with no reason.
c'mon man, i mean im able to run latest game that has better graphics with decent fps and got no performance issues, but look at what i got with this remastered is a performance issue, technical issue, network issue LOL.

tbh my expectation isn't that high, since i already knew that the games isn't heavily remastered or even a remake, but hey at least make the games optimized.
the only reason i bought this remastered is because i wanted to replay the games, so that i'll be able to feel the similliar experience that i have ever experienced as a kid playing the og ones, but with a slight improvement on the graphics and gameplay in it.

 My problems with the current state even after completing the main story.

Cons

1.  Throughout you WILL have to end up replaying some of the missions multiple times from the AI all of a sudden having a hive mind and all of a sudden they can all lazer you and you will die super quick especially on the early parts of the game. 

2. The achievements are busted. I have tried multiple times attempting to upgrade my armor in the game for those really hard missions at the beginning of the game but every time I would get to 10/12 for the mission it would stop spawning the criminals therefore making it impossible to complete.  I have also attempted basketball achievement to simply shoot at least 30 points in one session which could take literally minutes to complete and gone well over the limit to not get the achievement; which would prompt me to go reload my file and try again only to not be able to get the achievement no matter what I do. This is only a few of my experiences trying to get some of these achievements despite all odds the game just will not give it to you.

3. There are bugs of enemies once in a while spawning into stuff and being able to still shoot you or just not being there at all to begin with. Despite my best effort for it being a classic to me personally it can be really annoying sometimes for this being called the ""definitive edition"".

4. The cloud save is buggy sometimes. When I switch from my PC to my Steam Deck sometimes with cloud saving on I will not get the same states of where I was switching to a different system and losing saves and having to restart hellish missions that will make you want to commit a toaster bath 

Pros

1. It runs great on the steam deck and doesn't take too much battery so you can play it for a couple hours before you really need to start figuring out where your going to charge it. 

2. Even though when the game first came out the facial animations were really goofy they did fix it up a bit and  even though it isn't perfect, it has that old ps2 charm that I remember back in the day that really is a great experience playing.

3. Its got lots of things you can do and the humor in the game is hilarious especially playing this as a adult vs being a kid growing up now realizing how vulgar this game really was.

Verdict

The game still is a great time to play but it really does need more tweaks and needs way more support from Grove Street games and Rockstar for trying to push this game out at its state for a full price. If your going to pick this game up id 100% wait till its at LEAST 50% off for its current state

100% completed over 74 hrs.... 8/10 remaster....

Steady 60fps @2k max settings ( Same on GTA 3 & VC )  ( In few area's around LS and red county got 30fps
like something was loading or trying to... After leaving the area went back to 60 ) 
No stutters
Textures looks great compared to OG version 
2 Crash in 74hrs 

First off glad they got rid of that awful yellow fog from the OG Version now you can see everything... ( same in GTA 3 LC ) 

For the most part had a bug free playthrough and god i missed playing SA... Feature packed game from floor to ceiling. I have another version of it on the R* Launcher don't know if its the OG one, ( got it for free ) But i tried  playing it and couldn't, just because of its outdated textures.. I've always struggled with replaying games that old...  

I had a couple of crashes not doing anything other than just walking down the street with this one, And few times on VC i kept hearing explosions in the distance.. On SA it was more profound and soon figured that it was planes and heli's crashing into buildings.... And some cars spawning in buildings and blowing up.. 

Another bug that i ran into was save game icons in game would bug out, And either not open the menu to save or disappear but this only happened around second island and stopped when i progressed to the third island 
(work around i used.. Was try other save game icons from properties i bought or start a mission and get an autosave ) 

In some area's got mass frame drops and would hang till i left the area.. One was in Los Santos near the grave of Brian and Mom...( just the street block around the graveyard ) the other just to the right of a girlfriends farm in red county the only place's where frames would drop and hang @30fps..... 

GTA Trilogy DE Review 

All three games are enjoyable and great to revisit.. Tho rough around the edges..   

I've seen some of the videos of the first launch on R* a year ago and yeah it didn't go well  lol and can understand why many feel the way they do.. textures not lining up, spelling mistakes, low quality fps etc... 

But its clear that most of this has been cleaned up..  few bugs may remain but i didn't notice or run into those bugs at least any that are not from the OG Versions of the games 

With the remaster we lost a lot of music, And in SA in seems to be more profound than in VC... Few station only have couple of songs left and was running into the same song over and over again... 

From what i seen in the discussion tab for GTA SA... Its said that a mod will restore or you can drag old files into this one.. you will have to look it up for that... Its a shame but was to be expected in any remaster/remake. 

But am not gonna sit and cry about it or demand Rockstar do something about it.. I have a PC with internet browser and youtube with ad blocker just simple typed in GTA radio stations and what you know i have the old station again...  

If you really want to see what GTA was like 20yrs ago go get a PS2 and copies of the games bang that S^:T on. 
Its truly the only way to enjoy what we did back in the day.. and you will get cramp in your hand from the tiny PS2 controllers haha 

Still glad i ignored the neg reviews and just tried it for myself with steams great 2hr return policy ( cough cough Ubisoft) felt safe to give it a whirl. Should point out that all GTA games thrive on bad reviews and bad publicity and those that bought the game and refund just to leave a neg review.. were/are the cause of the game going up in the steam charts... talk about counter productive hahahahaha dumba$$


Totally worth full price... But like i said any game in a sale is a bargain.....

It was pretty cool to play this throwback of a game with RTX. I enjoyed it enough to complete it 100%, but I would still advise purchasing this game while it's on sale, as there is a moderate amount of bugs and janky controls for a remastered game. I think the game crashed on me a total of 5 times throughout the 80+ or so hours I played. Personally it doesn't bother me as much as some others. I can almost guarantee you It'll happen at least once to everyone. Lastly, the unrendered textures are still very much so prominent at times, especially outside Los Santos, I mainly refer to Red County and San Fierro in particular. It felt like I was playing the game on Ps2 and not in a nostalgic matter (The annoying is my Ps2 going to visit mars kind of matter). 

Regardless, it was a good use of $44AUD while I got some free time. Now to play the the other 2. I don't know if I'll 100% them. I only did this GTA because it is my favourite out of the franchise. We will see :)",1675262314,1675262314,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,True,

We would go over to my friends house literally every day after school with my PS2 copy of San Andreas and all the cheat codes written down on a piece of paper inside my backpack.

And it is for this reason, that these three Remakes are so disappointing. The original 3D-Trilogy of the Grand Theft Auto series did not only make my, but other childhoods as well. Not only that, but it also put Rockstar Games on the map for decades to come. You would certainly think that they would put some love into these three games especially, but they instead decided to hand the work to an under-staffed studio, which does not seem to have a single bit of love or care for the original titles. These games should have gotten the Rockstar treatment we have gotten used to: In-house development and a care for the tiniest of details.

Now, are these Remakes really that bad? No, not at all. All three titles look amazing with the new skyboxes, volumetric clouds, dynamic lights, upgraded models and AI-enhanced textures. But this is the bare minimum that they could have put into these games anyways, because underneath the new Unreal-Renderer there are still the old codebases running. This could have very well been a free update to the existing, older titles, as a gesture of good-will for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI or a tie-in event in GTA: Online. Yet, they decided to sell the Trilogy at full price, while they didn't even put a meaningful amount of resources into this project.

While I do realize that Grove Street Games (WarDrum Studios) is at fault here, it is not fair to give Rockstar Games a pass on this, like most GTA fans seem to do. They had to have at least taken a look onto these games and given the final green light to make this release happen. This makes them just as guilty for how bad these ports are.

And to withhold other remakes and updates for the PC version of RDR2, just because the reception to the Definitive Edition Trilogy wasn't as good as they had expected (deservingly) seems really petty and embarassing on Rockstar's part. And it is for all of these reasons, that I cannot recommend this game, while I do enjoy the new visuals, which will make the Trilogy viable for another decade.",1675101646,1675101646,False,111,4,0.829216241836547852,13,True,False,False,True,

I have been playing the old version (almost double the hours) for nostalgia sake simply because it has better features.

If you are looking for better lighting, graphics and shadows. This version of the game is awesome. I am also enjoying the Achievements for the game. Unfortunately that is where it ends.

The game is lacking so many features that made the old version great.

- Light poles do not have collision detection and sink through the road. Sometimes cars (including my own) drive straight through them.
- Collisions on some objects are a little buggy - the weighting for these gameobjects seem off and causes rubberbanding type physics
- The gym and other minigames are taken from the mobile version and its nowhere near as challenging/nerfed - you can pickup the heaviest weights from the beginning
- Streetlights or building lights do not emit light at night nor is there any kind of atmospheric moonlight - it is a very dark map, especially at night
- the combat system for controllers is janky - free aim is not smooth at all
- Some character models dont capture the original look
- Theres a fair bit of stuttering throughout the game
- Missing classic soundtrack that made the radio great. Including songs from LoveFist which is just strange

I applied for a refund but I had spent too much time with the game, I was keen on the achievements for it however the older version has a far more comprehensive environment and physics - not to mention things like ragdoll mods etc and basic QOL.

Will update as this progresses. If you can get your hands on the classic steam version via third party redeem code I'd activate the old game that way. 

Could not recommend this version in its current state.

UPDATE: 9hrs to 12hrs

I have continued with the game and progressed into the countryside/county area

The roads have holes in them where the texture/meshing does not connect to the next section of road or grass. I tried to walk over them to see if I would fall through the map, this did not happen however it looks like some kind of patched over collider has been placed over the top as a band aid solution. Quite bizarre.

The animation/characters continue to get worse as the game progresses but I am dealing with it for now.

The countryside at night is INCREDIBLY dark. The is no atmospheric lighting at night and some areas are almost pitch black bar the lights from your car. I do not know if this is on purpose but in one scenario I lost my car in the bush and had no clue where I was.

It seems as if they did not expect me to play this far into the game.

I played a mission with a combine/harvester that you steal from a farm, the mechanics when running over a hay bail were appauling, sending the hay bail object flying down the map at high speed for  it to sink into the world map. The harvester does not eat up the hay like it used to.

I would almost argue this was for better performance however I find that even on my 3080 with DLSS on, some areas I am getting a severe FPS dip. I just doesnt quite make sense at the moment.

I wanted to go to bed last night, but I bought it and installed it. Over 18 GB game instead of the 700 mb it was back in the days. When I started, it felt like a trip back to memory lane. The graffics looks so good. They really didn't lie it has the GTA 5 engine. It plays like a game of these days.

It's the fact that the OG versions of these games were replaced with these versions. The older versions run better and have so many mods that were created since the games were released on PC. 

I do have fun when playing the definitive edition versions though and it's nice to just install the game and not have to download graphics mods just to see a slightly more updated version of the game and also have better controller support without installing a mod. Plus the definitive edition versions lack the compatibility issues the older version may have with certain PC configurations. 

However, the definitive edition versions have so many issues as many people have already described: downgraded/weird looking character models, poor optimization especially for how the game looks, and bugs. A year later and these versions are extremely far from perfect. These games should have been remade from scratch using RAGE. We should have gotten something that looks like Vice City Rage with improved graphics and shaders. That would have been amazing, but one could only dream.

Is this game worth a buy? Maybe under these criteria: It's on sale, you have a powerful PC, and understand that these games were lazily ported over to Unreal Engine.

The different coloured clothing for pedestrians and some cut content for character clothes for gangs and peds has been added here. The reflections on cars also is worth a mention as well as some other small details like the explosion ash on the floor from blown up cars.

YOU'D BE BETTER OFF GETTING YOUR OLD PS2 / XBOX 360 / OG-STEAM VERSION! 

I brought this game in the hopes that I would get back the fun I had as a kid and for a while I was having fun.. 

Then I got to the gang wars and found a lot of the issues, so to those who don't know if you do 12 ""side missions"" in a cop car, fire truck, ambulance and a taxi (plus some others) the game gives you permanent bonuses i.e (cops = more armour with bullet proof vests and fire truck = no fire damage) but during these missions I found that going from level 8 to 9 nothing will load and your timer will slowly count down to 0 and you will FAIL! 

I had this happen several times with all the missions except the taxi ones. So pushing through that and trying to get my step above the other gangs I managed to finish them all (I did rage quit 7 separate times because the cops while doing police missions will come after you and ignore the people shooting at you, I was taken out by a cop car so many times its beyond a joke, if you stop the bike and try and hide the cops will just appear where your not looking!). So I got all my bonuses and then tried to do the gang wars... 

The AI is worse then I remember! I have the original GTA SanAndreas and the AI for your gang members isn't this bad, a lot of the times if not all the time your gang when not in a car will just stare at you and get killed, the other gangs have AK47s and SMGs and your gang have basic bitch pistols, bring 6 gang members you say? Well that's fine it'll be to much for the game to handle and 2 of the 6 will just stop moving all together. 

The ""bad"" gang path finding is also something else, you can simple walk around the block and the bad guys will walk to the other side of the city to path back to you, but if you leave the war zone you start it all again because ""You left""! I honestly really tried with this game and I had lots of fun up until this point but I really don't want to keep trying to play core parts of the game if it's this broken, I'll never be able to use my own gang to help cause a lot of the time the aren't even good for meat shields, the cops and other gangs will just spawn on you and every time you pause the game you will have to deal with a good 5 second studder before your game starts running correctly again.",1674558662,1675474606,False,48,0,0.692869365215301514,1,True,False,False,True,

Is it more fun than the original? No, the graphics make it look more eye-candy like, but that's about it, they did add extra variety to each individual pedestrian, which is a lovely detail.
As you may or may not be aware, this game is full of bugs that the original did not have. The original did have a few bugs, but for the most part they were very few in-between and harder to encounter than the ones found in this ""Definitive Edition"".
You cannot have custom music like in the original game by dropping music to a folder (the custom radio has been removed, from a 2004 game that HAD it...)
The camera is non-functional. (With the old camera, whenever you took pictures, those would save as in-game screenshots in a folder in your PC). You can take pictures with it, but no picture will be saved to your PC.
Still, having Steam achievements is nice I guess...
Is it fun? Yeah, can be.
Is it better than the original? Definitely NO. This is supposed to be a ""Definitive Edition"", but it has greatly failed, at the bare minimum, a Definitive Edition should have as few bugs as possible, and even though more bugs have been fixed than when the game came out, it's still full of them. Not only that, but it has had features replaced entirely or, much worse yet, completely removed or not working correctly.
Sometimes your feet will sink in some surfaces, pedestrians sometimes sit on the wrong part of a seat. (Easiest to see in benches by the beach in Los Santos)
In short; You can play this version of GTA San Andreas if you want, but the only worthy thing about it is that you get achievements on Steam and that it looks kinda prettier in most cases. If I were you I'd hesitate to buy this product unless its price is really lowered, I bought the Trilogy on a 50% sale and the value of the product is not really reflected well with the level of care, which is probably why when GTA VI comes out, I'll be extra hesitant to pick it up. (As I was with this product at first, I only ended up adquiring it since they did fix some of the bugs and put it on Steam, as well as put it on sale.)
It is also disappointing that despite all the resources they have nowadays as a company, they couldn't bother to for instance, bring PS2 co-op mode or something of the sorts.
Was it so hard, Rockstar? Because I do not think so.
I even got stuck at the pool game inside of the bar near Grove Street. (It all got stuck, extremely glitchy!)
Same can be said about the basketball mini-game too.
All in all, it's a fun experience, but for the price they're asking? Not worth it AT ALL. Enough said. Pick it up at your own discretion, and ONLY during a sale.",1674436556,1674437282,False,221,5,0.90113455057144165,0,True,False,False,True,

Impossible to calculate but I have over 5,000 hours in the original game (including SA-MP) and I can confirm these bugs were added by Grove Street Games in addition to uncommon crashes.

You may think that's hyperbole with all of the garbage releases in recent years (Halo: MCC, Assassin's Creed: Unity, Cyberpunk 2077, etc.), but I'm totally sincere. Here's a long list of everything I can think of that this game does poorly, as well as the mistakes made by Rockstar and co. themselves.

-Playstation players got unintended early access, meanwhile PC players had to wait days to play it after a few hours after launch with no explanation of why or when it would come back until the day before it finally did. Why? They left assets in the game code they didn't want public. Not just a few things, but a ton. If that doesn't speak to how amateur this project is, I don't know what does.
-The game released in an inexcusably abysmal state:
-This game is chock full of bugs. 
-The atmospheres of these games are ruined. Instead of GTA III's distinctly moody vibe, served by its blue tone and unusual soundscape, you have an ugly, grey, bland and overly dark visual backed by extremely muffled audio that sounds significantly worse than the original PC release. Instead of SA's sunny, orange hue, you have a generic artstyle. VC suffers from many of the problems found in the other two games, but it always had a vivid, larger than life aesthetic, and so the cartoony models and exaggerated colours don't look totally out of place.
-As a general statement about the artstyles of these games, they look too cartoony. This now seems to be purposeful, unlike the original games which only looked cartoony as a result of their limited technology and not due to an intended style. Now that we have better tech, there's no reason outside of budget and developmental constraints that they shouldn't look as realistic as they were originally intended to be. Colours are too vivid and the lighting gives everything a plastic, glossy look (characters look like action figures).
-Ambient occlusion is too strong, making the games look ridiculously dark at times - especially in cutscenes. Turning it off however makes the game look flat and outdated.
-Misaligned and ill fitting textures everywhere.
-Performance is dreadful. Why does a game from 2001, which looks worse in many areas than its original release, run significantly worse than brand new games built from the ground up released in 2023?
-""Improved combat"" is a lie. The auto aim isn't even as snappy as the controller input (GInput) mod for the original versions of the games. The only thing they did to improve it was allow you to move while firing some weapons and add a weapon wheel. Wow. Incredible.
-Missing music from the original games - a lot of it. Hardly ""definitive"", is it? You're a multi-billion dollar company. You make more in a year from GTA: Online than most game developers and publishers ever see. I'm certain you could've afforded to re-license some songs, cheapskates... just as I'm sure you could've afforded to hire more than some mobile developers to remaster the games that got you where you are today.
-Censorship: GTA III, and to a lesser extent, GTA VC's heavy dismemberment, made killing so satisfying. Now there are just occasional decapitations. Why?
-Rockstar exclusive for a year with no announcement that it would come to any other platform until it randomly appeared a week or so ago on Steam. Why? They didn't want people waiting to purchase it on Steam. They wanted us to buy it on the Rockstar Game Launcher. Exclusives suck as is, but most publishers at least tell players ahead of time they they're limited exclusives. Rockstar didn't want to do this.
-Misspellings everywhere due to AI upscaling. These should've been impossible to miss.
-Again the audio is horrendous. Why does everything sound so muffled?
-III and particularly VC have the worst AI I've ever seen in video games, regardless of era. Unbelievably, they're even WORSE now.
-Broken collision and geometry. Fall through maps, hit invisible fences, etc.
-The occasional clunkiness of the original games' movement hasn't been resolved.
-Minor but still noticeable and offensive changes to gameplay - both done on purpose and things overlooked.
-AI upscaled textures are the bane of modern modding and game development, from a consumer's point of view. I have no idea why anyone thinks these look good. I've yet to see a single example of upscaled textures, outside of ultra low resolution pixel art that looks like anything other than a grainy, fake mess. This game's full of them.
-The radar now has a GPS for mission objectives that you can't turn off. This is a nice addition as an option, but the maps are small enough so as to not warrant it for me personally, and so I'd rather be able to use the minimap to plan my route myself on the fly without being guided the whole way through. It's a difficult thing to ignore. Honestly, this is one of my biggest gripes with this release even though I appreciate what they were trying to do. Is it really that hard to just add an option to disable it, though? GTA IV and V have this option.
-A full year later and almost nothing has changed. It's been a year since we've had a sizeable update.
-No separate sensitivity settings for vehicles and on-foot.
-Rockstar and Grove Street Games were dismissive in attitude towards their massive failure, adding further insult to injury. The fake apologies were late, too.
-You can't buy the games separately... despite launching and downloading them separately. Why? Because Rockstar knows nostalgia is a powerful tool and that people will pay the full price of admission for even one of these games. People can rightfully bag 343i all they want, but when they re-released the Halo games on Steam, they didn't force you to buy all of them at once. They allowed you to buy each of the six games contained by themselves, paying only $11AUD for each. THAT's good customer service and business practise. What Rockstar have done here is spit in your face.
-Even for 3 remastered games, regardless of how well they released, $90AUD is a lot to charge.
-Camera modes are weird. They're either too close or too far. No in between. I don't have this problem with the originals or other Rockstar games.
-Auto view centering is really annoying. Please let us turn it off.
-Even the desktop/Steam icons look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dreadful.
-The price is much higher in some regions because Rockstar are idiots.
-Some achievements are mission specific, and given that you can't replay individual missions, if you miss it the first time then you have to restart the entire game just to get to the point where you can earn the achievement again. Some of these are ""secret"" achievements, too. The developers realise these are incredibly long games, right?
-The difficulty of these games have been decreased in specific missions for the sake of bad players.

I'm a complete and utter moron and so I bought these on Steam (I refunded them on Rockstar when I bought them on launch). I love these games so much and even if they're inferior versions, having an excuse to replay them by getting all the achievements was incentive enough for me to buy them at half price. I'm also delusional enough to hold onto hope that they may be fixed one day. In other words, I'm a total sucker, and that's exactly how these companies get away with treating us like crap: because suckers like me will still buy them despite causing a fuss. This negative review won't do anything to prevent this garbage collection from being a top seller, and why bother to fix it when despite being upset about it, I'm still going to buy all future GTA titles? They don't have any reason to. I don't really know what point I'm trying to make... I just want to acknowledge the irony of me paying for these pieces of crap while complaining that they're pieces of crap. It isn't lost on me and I am part of the problem. Hopefully you won't be and you'll either pirate this ♥♥♥♥ or just play something more worth your time.",1674378313,1674451757,False,48,3,0.697857677936553955,0,True,False,False,True,

The visuals are very bizarre, and just look very strange. The textures were clearly upscaled without actually looking at them, and the models can be very strange as well. This may just be my opinion, but the game just looks so strange. I somewhat got used to it, but never fully.

Many cutscenes seemed to have issues, with characters walking into walls. Lampposts and streetlights would fall into the ground when you hit them with a car, which could be in the original game as well, but it's still strange.

The performance was not good. This was clearly not optimized very well. (I would like to note that I played on linux, so maybe some of these are not the games fault, but I doubt that from what others are saying.) Sometimes after finishing a mission or just going into the menu, the game would drop to about 20 fps and stay around there for a while before suddenly returning to 60. There were also some stutters as well.

The worst part about this is that we can no longer buy the original trilogy on steam, so we are stuck with the defective editions. I would not recommend this, even for 50% off and certainly not $60.

Lighting
Draw distance 
More diverse NPC's
Better textures (In most cases) 
Radio wheel
Weapons wheel
More details in certain places (Garages, graffiti on walls etc) 


Cons:

Annoying mobile controls (Lifting weights, sprinting, riding bicycle, using hydraulics, flying, lowrider minigame is really easy and simplified)
The characters looks like jelly. (Riding bikes, in cutscenes etc) 
Clothes (EX: Green jeans has the texture sideways it seems. Looks horrible) 
Ghost fences. (You can clip through them while driving) 
Destroying traffic lights and lamp posts makes them fall through the ground
Looking around with mouse feels weird and slow (the camera tries to center when you look around) 
Most characters looks off (babyface, doll'ish) 
Horrible LOD's

Overall it is playable but many bugs (mostly minor) here and there slowly annoys you more and more over time. 
It's not usual Rockstar quality. I'd say get it only on sale. Or not. It's your money. 

EDIT:

I have now completed the game and found several other bugs and annoying stuff:

Transfender and Wheel Arch Angels are missing several tuning options on different cars. You can still select the options in the menu but it is invisible on the car/changes nothing. 
Wheel Arch Angels parts can change color after storing in garage. 
When buying food you can't see the health bar.
The Stat messages can often not be seen. You can hear the sound of stat message but can't see what is actually changing. (Ex: muscle, respect, girlfriend progress, skills etc) 
When exiting a vehicle you can't leave the door open anymore.
I have had my car go up in flames and explode several times after running a ped over even though the car wasn't damaged at all. 
The jetpack controls are really dumb. Increasing and decreasing thrust is with the mouse which is also used for aiming and shooting so you cant really shoot when flying jetpack. So alternative strats must be used during green goo. 

All in all the game looks really good on the surface especially the lighting and vehicles. You can complete it as well but will find many (mostly minor) annoyances along the way.

I have had fun, and I will probably continue to have fun, but this is not a GTA game. This feels more like Goat Simulator than GTA. It is a terrible mobile port touched up by terrible AI and not double checked by literally anyone. And It is not optimized what so ever. It won't matter how good your PC specs are, it won't run nearly as good as it should. In a very short amount of time I've had a tremendous amount of bugs. Rock/ground layers floating in air, sound of the beach is hitting metal instead of hitting sand, when your vehicle goes underwater the radio will continue playing even after your car lights die, tries outside of buildings will go through and back out of the buildings, bicycle wheels are halfway through the ground layer, I've had light poles spawn inside my stationary vehicle, the water hose on the fire truck will not hurt people inside vehicles or even trigger any aggression from them, the water hose on the fire truck will knock people down but will not hurt or trigger aggression from them, I hit a curb at low speed and did 20 flips in a 30 foot span and set my vehicle on fire, and many more I'm sure I can't remember. 

Edit: Today I ran over a person and killed them. They levitated about a foot from the ground, bent at 45 degree angle, in a T-pose. With a rectangular shadow box on the ground. 

Edit 2: I've had my bumper fall of and hover about a foot of the ground at a 45 degree angle and it was firmly in place in the air. I also saw a person ride an invisible motorcycle. 

Edit 3: I've had the game do what appears to be a crash. The game will lock up and start a loud screech like it has crashed. I open Task manager and close after several attempts the game will load back up where it left off but with the pause menu open. I would recommend saving frequently.

I own the original edition on Steam, so when this was first released, I redownloaded it and played it. After all, mods can do everything this game did and more right? Well, I found modding this game to be a bit troublesome. I would have numerous issues, either with the gamepad mods to work with certain missions, such as the lowrider mission or even just using hydraulics in general. Other times, I would start missions and my game would instantly crash, like the missions OG Loc gives you after the bike chase. I would scour gtaforums and Reddit and other things to find fixes to these issues but would often spend more time troubleshooting issues than actually enjoying the game. Or, with an unlocked frame rate, I would be unable to use the treadmill unless I went and edited the FPS back to 30. I just had a bunch of weird issues like that. Ultimately, that's just a thing that happens when you try to play older games on newer OS's and hardware. In some cases they are kind of tricky to get working just right.

I don't have any of those issues in this game. 

There are also so many other good QOL changes they made in this game. For instance, in the original, scrolling through menus at Burger Shot was annoying because you had to press the button to see each next food item individually. Now there is a list. You can instantly replay missions after failing them, unlike before where you had to drive all the way back to mission start each and every time. The controller support is good, there's a weapon wheel, unlocked framerate that has none of the issues I mentioned above and more.

Is it a perfect remake? No way. The new textures look...weird. On max settings, some things look surprisingly good, but on weird blocky textures and it just doesn't look right. The original game with graphics mods does feel better, in my opinion. Also the way in which Rockstar rolled this game out originally is really bad, and there was no quality control at all. It's also a shame they didn't release this on Steam with a new patch that would fix issues other people are having. You also can't rebind buttons on the controller (shame).

But overall, I think comparing the two experiences, I have had a better time with this version of the game then trying to deal with the modded version, with all it's issues framerate issues and crashing.

So, I just started the game. I do not have much nostalgia for it. It runs on Steam Deck (nice!), but sometimes the controls (press A) did not work as intended or the movement animation was even faster and weider than in the original (getting thrown out of the car and getting up). Might be a shuttering issue on the deck. So yeah, this game needs more resources than the original. But gladly no more modding.

By far though, the one thing I absolutely hate is how the atmosphere is completely massacred in this one, every weather looks identical and it really lacks the charm the original had. While the original used far more outdated technologies, they were utilized with love and passion and because of that, they actually looked good. Here on the other hand, it almost feels like AI upscaling wasn't the only thing involved in the remaster, it feels like the AI remastered the entire game. I can't stress this out enough but don't buy these, unless they're really cheap or they end up getting fixed at some point. If you want to look at my other reviews, feel free to do so, as I talk about more of the problems in them and I don't want to repeat myself over and over again.

A spit in the face to the millions of fans who grew up with these (once upon a time) masterpieces. Completely butchered by a money-hungry company, which does not care about you and about the community.

After countless takedown notices of mods, lawsuits and complete neglect towards the fans... you can clearly see where the priorities of Rockstar Games and Take 2 Interactive lie... your wallet and pleasing the investors.

These ""remasters"" are very portly made, many new glitches and problems were introduced, all in the favor of graphics, which in same cases are worse, especially on the characters.

I am a content creator and that's the only reason I bought it both on RGL when it released for 60 euro and on Steam for 30 euro. Each game is probably worth not more than 1 euro and I would only recommend it for 95% off for the whole package.

I really wished they had fixed some of the issues with this game, especially the performance. Unfortunately, it seems the game has not been patched for the Steam release. To me, the original versions are still way better in terms of stability and performance, and also atmosphere and art style. Yes, I know this has some fancy effects the originals didn't, and some of those features are great, but the vibe is gone. Los Santos doesn't seem sunny and hot, like it did in the originals, and the new character models are still completely terrible, even though Rockstar has had over a year to fix this.

With regards to the quality of the remastered trilogy, it seems there are two kinds of people:

Those who don't care and just enjoy the trilogy remaster despite some bugs or shortcomings. These will probably tell you that the game is perfectly fine, no bugs, no issues, and that the people complaining are just whiny idiots. If you are one of thee, good for you, enjoy the games!

...then there's those that would rather wait until the game hopefully gets some more patches. Many of these people will probably tell you the game is completely broken and unplayable.

Personally, I'll wait for patches or mods that fix the problems that are present right now. The animation glitches weird me out, I'm sad that San Andreas doesn't have the sunny vibes anymore, and I can't stand the weird gamepad-ish mouse controls, among other things.

I'll wait for a couple of days, and if a patch doesn't arrive, I'm probably going to refund this. Waay too many issues to justify this, even at a 50% discount.",1674155837,1674155837,False,171,4,0.818920910358428955,0,True,False,False,True,
