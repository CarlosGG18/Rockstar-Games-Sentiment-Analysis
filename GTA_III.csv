Unlike 90%+ of the reviews here who are absolutely blinded by nostalgia, this game has aged pretty poorly. Before thinking that my opinion is wrong and that I didn't play enough, I was on the third last mission called Espresso-2-go where I gave up. I had to drive around trying to find coffee stalls on a map that didn't help me at all, nor gave me their location unless I got really close to them. Below I'll give a list of positive and negatives about this game.

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
[h1]Graphics[/h1]
For a 2002 game, I was expecting the graphics to not be that great, but upon loading the game I was pleasantly surprised with how good it looked. Sure, things like textures were blurry at times and appeared stretched, but they didn't look that bad. Character models looked decent, and had a nice art style.

[h1]Voice acting[/h1]
For a decent amount of games in the early to mid 2000's, voice acting was usually pretty cheesy, or just wasn't that good. GTA 3's voice acting is pretty decent for it's time. The use of emotion when speaking can be heard, and I really like that.

[h1]Use of humour[/h1]
Whilst playing, you can already hear and see Rockstar's funny use of humour. Of course it's not as overboard as it is today, but it still is funny. For example the radio station called Chatterbox, where people call in and talk about funny and random topics. Not only that, but I remember in one mission called escort service where you have to escort a van with a logo of a company called Gruppe sechs. It honestly made me laugh.

...And that's where all the positives for this game end.

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[h1]Story[/h1]
I don't necessarily think the story was bad, I just couldn't really get into it. Not only that, but I didn't really connect with barely any of the characters. They were forgettable.

[h1]Side missions[/h1]
I didn't do any of the side missions, so that's why I'm putting it here.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
[h1]Very average PC port[/h1]
Now where do I start with this? The game doesn't even run at 60fps, it runs at 30 by default. Turning off the in-game frame limiter makes the game run above 30fps, but causes problems like timing issues and general bugs and physics problems. It can also cause problems when in the menu, as you can't even see any of the buttons. Not only that, but weapons fire faster, some audio like NPC's talking cuts off mid-sentence, the firetruck can't fire water, it's effects are broken and this makes the side missions not possible to play. In order to fix this you have to download a mod. This caps the fps to 60 which allows the game to be played normally, however, the car physics are a bit messed up and NPC voices still get cut off. Not only that, but connecting a controller doesn't show it's controls and only shows keyboard controls. You need another mod to also fix this.

[h1]Very poor gameplay design[/h1]
I have no clue what Rockstar were thinking when they did this, but there is no restart checkpoint or mission screen if you fail a mission. For example, if I was to start a mission and go to the other side of the city and fail, I'd have to drive all the way back to the mission marker and do it all over again. This seriously tested my patience at times. Not only that, but if you died anytime while free roaming or in a mission you'd get revived at a hospital. Doesn't sound bad right? Wrong. All your weapons and ammunition are now gone, and you have to go back and buy them all over again. What's that? You want to know where the ammo store is because we took your guns from you? Too bad. We're not going to put it on the map at all, you have to drive around aimlessly hoping to find it.

[h1]No map screen[/h1]
This one is pretty common if not standard in all open-world games nowadays, so it's extremely frustrating knowing this game doesn't have it. I failed miserably trying to remember where things were, so only giving me a small map at the bottom left of the screen doesn't really help me.

[h1]No save button in the menu[/h1]
What was Rockstar thinking with this? Not being able to save in the menu itself and only at your safe house is such a dumb decision. Having the ability to save right outside where a mission started would save me so much time, rather than having to drive all the way to a safe house to save.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
Overall, I know that this game was released almost 21 years ago, but I just couldn't get into this game. I really tried to like it and see the positives, but the negatives it had outweighed them. I can clearly see that this game was extremely visionary, advanced and well above its competition for it's time. It really gives evidence as to why people say that Rockstar helped create the open-world genre as it's 100% true. While this game was well ahead of its time, it hasn't aged very well at all. From things such as a no restart checkpoint or mission menu to a very poor PC port, the experience I had at the start of the game to the end went from one of positivity to one of anger and frustration.

I'd honestly recommend you just watch a play through on YouTube rather than playing this. Or wait for a discount on the remastered series. I really hope that Vice City and San Andreas are better. Overall, I'd give this game a 3/10.",1678359098,1678359189,False,0,1,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False,True,

I do not understand why they do not sell  ""𝘋𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘷𝘦 𝘌𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯"" on steam and give the other 3 away for free if you buy it. Even if they charged for all 6 games but they do not sell any of them on steam. If you going to do a cash grab you would make more money selling all 6 games on steam so I do not get the logic there.

There is some people who only play steam who will never try the old or new version now.

You can still buy the key of this original game on Eneba for under $3 as of today for the steam version so that is cool. Some games delisted from steam it is almost impossible to find a key to buy them.

I have never played the DE to give my opinion on that but if I was you I would either buy the key of the 3 old versions or buy the DA on whatever platform you want to play it even if it means buy from rockstar directly for pc.


--------------------------


As for the actual review of this game it is like playing the original COD.


GTA 1 and 2 were never as good as 3.

If you a GTA fan you should try either this old version or the new one at least once. The DE has much better graphics but the atmosphere is much more happy and in this old version it is more gloomy. 

""GTA III was meant to be a game that's very grey-ish, gritty and gloomy. It is not supposed to be another San Andreas, yet that is just what Grove Street Games gave us.""

Rockstar did not even make the DE themselves.

Grand Theft Auto III, or as most of us call it, GTA3, is an open-world, third-person crime game taking place in the early 2000s. All of the events happen in Liberty City. Liberty City which is based upon cities known for gang activity and crime, like Detroit and Philadelphia. Lastly, I should mention that GTA3 is the first mainstream, 3D open-world game, which is still a formula of success.

[h1]🎮Gameplay[/h1]
As mentioned above, GTA3 is the grandfather of modern games. We see more and more games opt in for an open-world setting because of the success that the Grand Theft Auto series had. Having never played this GTA installment, I decided to play through it more than twenty years after release and see how it holds up.

Let's start with the open-world mechanics, as they were the highlight of this game. Liberty City still feels like a dynamic place. People walk around in a funny and animatronic manner, with vehicles going around city streets, planes gliding through the sky and boats dashing through the waves. The result of that randomness gives the sensation and atmosphere of a life-like city with how things are going. Of course, being the protagonist will also get you the chance to take part in various activities and missions. You discover more areas of the map by progressing throughout the story. Keep in mind that with every new part of the city, you will be able to complete side missions and mini-games.Talking about missions, most of them are well crafted. Their design is  simple, go to point A, steal or kill your target and return to base. That may sound easy, but in practice, it can get a lot more entertaining and challenging! The variety of the missions also helps in keeping you engaged. Every mission has a different theme or agenda behind it, sometimes you drive in a win or lose race, and other times you start a gang war with the Chinese. That is a very strong aspect of this game.

https://youtu.be/CJeIqOmgMRk

Being a fantastic sandbox it allows you to waste time on this game. Fighting against the police with your comically large inventory is a classic gaming moment. Stealing a nice sports car and exploring Liberty City is something everyone should do.

The shooting mechanics have aged badly, which isn't a surprise. Aiming might feel rusty and unresponsive, especially with a scoped weapon. Hit reg is also abysmal, although it is excusable due to the age.

[h1]🎭Story[/h1]
[h2]This review contains no spoilers.[/h2]
Something to be expected is that the story has a lot to do with crimes, backstabbing and revenge. You being a silent protagonist makes the entire story hit or miss. You never see Claude react to much at all. He feels programmed and stoic. It might seem like a terrible aspect, but at the same time, it makes everything seem deeper story-wise. I found myself constantly wondering about Claude's motives because of his mysterious and quiet persona. The other characters presented throughout the story are memorable and also impactful. The entire plot gave me the idea that there is always a risk, someone you trust will betray you for their own personal gain. On your journey to redemption you do the same to others that helped you and use them as a tool. I am avoiding spoilers but these are the motives of the story to my understanding.


I spent 15 hours with the game, which is a decent time. Considering how engaging the events are, I would easily consider the story as another strength of this title.

[*] [b]Graphics[/b]
In some way, Rockstar did revolutionize games graphically as well, although it also did fail in some other areas. Building and overall environmental design are beautiful to this day. You can't stroll through Liberty City and say that this game looks ugly. The issue in this game starts when you're looking at details. The characters do look geometrical even for their time. Textures seem as if someone painted with crayons on them.  Animations are also somewhat of a weak point.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack[/b]
Arguably the best part of this game, despite having a silent protagonist; the voice actors were fantastic. Background sounds and noises were also a quality addition. The soundtrack is what makes this experience unforgettable, perfectly capturing the era of this game and also bombarding me with nostalgia… ah the 2000s… good times! Also, the entire presentation of the main menu is iconic. The screen is black, and you can hear the relaxing piano theme playing in the background as the menu slowly shows up. It makes you forget about your disappointing life and that you’re living from paycheck to paycheck…anyway, the soundtrack by itself is worth the money.[/list]

Being such an old title, we have to expect technical difficulties. To bypass most of the issues I would suggest enlightening yourself with this guide: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1744154318]Click here![/url].
In 15 hours of beefing with Chinatown people I experienced some minor glitches and bugs. Luckily for me, I had no crashes, although that could be the case because I installed most of the fixes. Trying to run the game without any patch might be frustrating as I couldn’t even start the game without crashing.
[/list]
[h1]⚖️Conclusion[/h1]
Grand Theft Auto III truly is a legend. It still performs 20 years later and was able to give me some good hours of entertainment. The game isn’t available anymore on the Steam store page, but you can find Steam keys using 3rd Party sites for the price of a coffee.

[b]A short description[/b]
Grand Theft Auto III is a 3D open world game developed by DMA Design (Now known as Rockstart North) that is set in the fictional Liberty City (based on NY). The story follows Claude Speed's seek for revenge after a robbery gone wrong.
As many know, this game is legendary, and it's gameplay has been documented and reviewed by thousands. In this review, I will focus on other aspects that many haven't really touched.

[b]Behind the soundtrack[/b]
This game's soundtrack is brilliant to say the least. With the musical background the Sam and Dan Houser, Rockstar managed to create a legendary sountrack. There is a total of 9 radio stations, 1 of which is a talk radio hosted by Lazlow Jones. Rockstar managed to mock the radio stations of the time that the game was released. The songs were written entirely in Rockstar's studios. They also used real DJs to portray those on the radio.

[b]The game before 9/11[/b]
The 9/11 attacks changed a few different aspects of the game. For example, one striking change was the original cover art(which was still used for the European version) which according to Rockstar themselves was ""too raw"". The cover used in US laid the foundation of what would become a legendary art style that would be used for the future GTAs. Another example is the police cars; initially their colour scheme was that of the NYPD cars, but Rockstar changed them to generic black-and-white design. One of the most beloved cut was the character Darkel which was a character that wanted to bring down the city's economy. Darkel was removed because his missions were a bit too violent.

[b]The Definitive Edition[/b]
GTA III has a few ports, including a mobile port developed entirely by War Drum Studios (now known as Grove Street Games) and the Definitive Edition (which isn't great and is based on the mobile ports). The latter is the reason why the original version was removed from the Steam store. The Definitive Edition fails to offer a good experience, as it is riddled with countless bugs, features that don't work properly and doesn't retain the original art style of the game. The dark and grim aspect of Liberty City is gone. The character's models look like cartoons. Personally, I dispise the definitive edition.

[b]re3[/b]
Thanks to the community, the original version was reverse-engineered by a team of six fans. The project is called re3, and they released the source code and executable not only for Windows, but for GNU/Linux too. With the help of their amazing work, now Linux players can play this amazing masterpiece natively and with a lot of modern touches.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
It is, and forever will be, one of greatest video games of all time. Shame on Take Two for making Rockstar remove the original and perfectly functional version in favor of a version that offers a bad and inconsistent experience. I recommend the original version, or even better, use re3. Don't support Take Two's mistake.",1658081092,1658081092,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking

I'm trying to get out of the habit of reviewing games without beating them (I only finished the first island), but you can't buy this version anymore anyway, and as far as I can tell I can't actually progress further without using an exploit (will explain).

+ The radio is the one saving grace of this game. This game deserves one positive thing, so I will give it that. There isn't [i]that[/i] much variety, and it got repetitive, but I did actually enjoy listening to insane rants on 109 The Chatterbox, or the satirical commercials about buying monkeys.

= Story and voice acting are middling.
= Graphics are terrible, though that's to be expected.

- [b]In order to be playable, this game needs driver-level vsync enabled, as it was only designed to run at 30 fps.[/b] On my GPU, at least, this forces the game to run at 60 fps. At unlimited framerates, reversing in vehicles (among other things) is completely broken, taking multiple minutes to move one car length.
- Aiming is absolutely awful, especially with the sniper rifle.
- Driving sucks. Controlling vehicles just doesn't feel good. On top of that, vehicles seem very easy to damage, and when a small mistake means your vehicle is upside-down, on fire, and/or in the ocean, the game encourages [i]careful[/i] driving. This can be especially annoying during missions, where I failed a few times just due to a mishap while driving, not due to the mission's actual content.
- The camera controls are annoying, as is its behavior during reversing a vehicle.
- The minimap is basically useless. First of all, it is zoomed so far in that it's hard to see anything of value, and I had to memorize the shape of city blocks to remember where to find things. It does show significant location icons outside missions, but during a mission they all disappear. This makes finding the Pay 'n' Spray during a police chase mission obnoxious. It feels intentional, but...that's why the Pay 'n' Spray exists, is it not? The map is also buggy -- in the following missions, the target's location often disappeared, so I couldn't complete the mission.
- If you fail a mission, you have to go back to the person you got it from and re-accept it. This wasn't a big deal, until it was. I failed ""Last Requests"" and was respawned in Portland. My boat despawned, and as far as I can tell, since Maria was already on Staunton Island, there was no way for me to get a new one to get back to Asuka with, outside exploiting the mechanics or plain cheating. Therefore, I'm just stuck.
- Nitpick: The cell phone icon reappeared to get the mission ""Turismo"" from El Burro, even after I had completed all of his missions.

Not completely by myself but through my older brother's save or something, I think. Anyway, I was maybe 14 at a time, so it was different than playing it now at age of 33. 

And boy, what a difference 20 years do make. Granted, reviewing this now is just for my own sake because no one can buy this version anymore, but what was more or less revolutionary 20 years ago in gaming, has not aged very well. A lot of things felt janky and lots of quality of life things that have come standard nowadays are missing here.

I think the biggest thing this game has in 2022 going for it is some of the characters. That's about it. The story isn't spectacular and has simply an light overarching connection altogether. 

But especially because of that, I would have preferred them to use this as a base of the ""Definite Edition"" they pushed out rather than what we did get.

There was no ""I played this as a kid, I love it"" nostalgia. It's more of a ""memories grow sweeter with time"" kind of deal. But to see what this truly was, and where it all became, playing t his was good.

At it's age, a lot of the ""side-activities"" of finding packages, doing odd-jobs as EMT etc. just don't feel like good waste of time. That being said, I guess it took me 10 to 12 hours to beat this with being sucky at games.",1655211947,1655212256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

To tell the truth, Grand Theft Auto III (2001) was without a doubt a phenomenal game to the industry of action genre.

Yet the game itself never was something I might call part of my childhood, but one more Grand Theft Auto someone would have found worthwhile and predecessor of legendary Vice City and San Andreas.

In my opinion the story in this part is just a skippable element of the background to make an aim for the missions, yet what definitely holds the story inside it is the city.

Atmosphere of the foggy and jazz-y town has its special attributes taking you into the early 2000.

Also, when we play through the whole trilogy of 3D Universe we can see how the gameplay and ideas of the developers vary from game to game.

- Guns and Cars.
- Needs to apply an easy fix for it to work on Win 10 and newer (see GTA3 Steam community guide).
- The Dodo can actually fly.

SCORE:
8 out of 10

This game made a revolution to 3D open world games, it's an absolute must have and play.
It's long enough to keep you driving, doing missions, shooting and exploding stuff on the open world, and short enough that makes it possible to actually complete 100% of the game without sacrificing your life to it.

TIP:
Before doing story missions read a ""100% guide"" so you can make the side missions you think are useful, or all if you want to get to the 100%. Paramedic missions will give health and adrenaline on safe houses, and gives you the useful unlimited running perk, hidden objects will give you guns and armor on safe houses, taxi missions will improve the taxi cars, and so on. You can do them later, but after the story missions some gangs will hate you and get in your way to make those side missions.
Money on this game does not matter that much, after a few missions (story or side) you'll have enough for the rest of the game, it will just pile up.

Unfortunately this game is not for sale anymore (only included in the Definitive Edition), but let's review it anyway!

This is a pioneer of a game from the series humble 3D beginnings. That being said there's lots of things that the GTA series is known for that isn't in this game.

- The protagonist isn't voiced
- The story is really bad, uninspired and short (almost no dialogue)
- There are no motorcycles
- The missions are generic and mostly forgettable
- The characters are almost cartoony in their acting
- No map, only a mini map, can't stress how bad this is

That being said the Gameplay is quite fun. It uses the regular lineup of weapons that are being used in all games. The driving is fun - on PC definitely better than the GTA IV driving - and the missions serves their purpose of doing things that are fun.

The map is OK, but it is a three part Liberty City after all. The 2nd island is better than the 1st, but the 3rd island only has one proper mission attached to it. It shares the blandness, almost batman like, style of GTA IV and in my opinion a proper GTA game needs more color, as is the case with Vice City, San Adreas and GTA V.

The game is a bit cheap at times, and sometimes you just need to get lucky with the missions.

Do I recommend it? Maybe... just to see the beginnings of the franchise. GTA Vice City excelled the structure in every single way, and is my personal favourite of the PS2-era GTA games. This game is mostly forgettable though.

The missions unfortunately are often too frantic, timed and/or escort missions. There are very few missions where one can take their time and approach the goal as one pleases. There are no memorable heists and even after playing it I'd say there are few missions that I find all that interesting. The biggest problem is that there is no real story, and even though you are the active part it feels like you have no control of the story whatsoever - you just do what people tell you without question. You never feel like you know how things tie together, why Catalina is ""the bad guy"" (Catalina's character is very poorly told), and when you're done - what the heck did you accomplish?

Like said, the ""story"" is bare bones, the game is mostly just gameplay with some minor story elements attached to them.

On a positive note: the radio stations are amazing! You'll be introduced to Lazlo in the amazing Chatterbox radio station, one of the best GTA radio stations ever made. Chatterbox is truly GTA radio done right, and as a talk show - albeit short - it might just be the best in the series. Worth to play the game just for this radio station alone.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

Helpful advice I found on a mod-page: if you want to change (fix) your resolution but can't see the game's menu screen/it's randomly invisible, toggle the Steam overlay. This also works with Vice City/S.A. Go team.

Here are a few reasons why:

-Not sure if it is a bug but the cars and player can die/explode VERY quickly, you can go from 100 armor and 100 HP to dead in seconds
-A lot of missions have you escorting NPCs who can die very quickly
-This extreme damage ALSO applies to the NPCs you escort, making you fail missions regularly 
-Missions have no checkpoints, meaning if you fail them at any point you have to restart them
-If you need to restart a mission, you can not just restart it right away after you fail, you have to drive all the way back to the mission giver across the map to restart the mission
-You can not jump out of burning cars OR swim = in either situation it means you die instantly and have to restart the mission
-You have to stand still to fire any weapon bigger than an SMG, similar to older games like Resident Evil (it feels OFF)

I loved this game back in the day, Don't get me wrong - it paved the way for its sequels and most open world games even to this day.

 (Notice: at the request of the publisher, Grand Theft Auto III is no longer available for sale on Steam.) 

               The gaming community did work to update this game outside of steam PC application platform, extensive programming for many hardware fixes and startup patch's for the game.                       They simply disrespected all the programmers who fixed their product, just for the end result of this classic game being removed due to carelessness of the publisher and developer.  They want to push sales of their new remake, when they could not even finish it.

The game is still better than GTA 5 online on a good day when no one bothers you, just because it still has its rough magic touch of old simplistic perfection with-in a nostalgia educed dazed perspective.       That is my simple opinion about the new and old idealistic views on the games of its kind.        The programming community would fix games as a side project even when they don't get paid to make people at the companies look bad, whats their excuse for not making a patch for a game that had some of the record breaking sales of over 155 million, last date of earnings count was Nov 3, 2021, really and they could not pay two programmers for less than two months or less to fix the game and update it, just to earn a million or more for paying for work and updating a legal copy right licence for the PC version on the digital market, or even release a game update patch, for continued sales.   

The game I bought works just okay after the community fixes, some basic windows security settings changes but, the people who wanted the original game have to resort to other means to get it <(""_"")>P  or find a legit key steam key seller online shop.

maybe if you play it heavily modded, or get the remaster it would definently be worth it, but vanilla gta 3 is not worth playing now.

a handful of missions are near impossible, if you fail a mission you have to completley restart, driving feels like aids a lot of the time and cars have no health, if you have 2 monitors you literally cant click on your mouse, things pop in 10 feet from you when driving.

I have valid reasons on why this game is not good but first I just want to say there is aspects and glimmers of greatness in GTA III. It's groundbreaking for the series and open world games in general and there was never one like this back in the early 2000's. There is not many games at that time where you can murder pedestrians with a big arsenal. The cars in the game are surprisingly varied and have a good sense of weight and speed to them. There is a certain freedom in the mission design unlike the latest GTA and RDR2, sometimes limitations can be a blessing. 
With all the good things out of the way, the bad things outweigh them all and causes me to lose my mind. First things first, the story: It's very unique compared to other GTA's because you have a mute protagonist. The intro to the game gives us context to why our protagonist, named Claude, does all these jobs for these rich and hardened criminals. It's because his girlfriend betrays him, shoots him in the face and leaves him for dead. Claude wants revenge of course and he doesn't care how many suicide missions he has to go on, just to kill this one broad. He's a nothing character, he has one goal, he does not speak, doesn't have a clear personality, we can't hear his thoughts, he's just you, the player. There is many games where they make a silent protagonist work, like Link from TLOZ or Crash from Crash Bandicoot, there's so many ways to give these characters charming personalities while telling a fun story. In GTA III, the story revolves around Claude just doing jobs for multiple people then betraying those people to do more jobs for a different group of people, it's easily exhausting and not fun to experience. 
The controls have aged so poorly that drinking expired milk would feel more rewarding. I get that it's an old game but not even the definitive edition fixes these janky controls. The shooting is bad, the trilogy is often sighted for having terrible aiming controls, it's hard to explain but you just have to play it to see for yourself. Driving is fine and works but driving the boat or the plane is easily frustrating, it's nothing but bad missions when it comes to driving these floaty and drifty  vehicles in order to progress the story.
Most missions are pretty simple, drive this car to this destination, kill these guys or collect this item. Some of them get pretty inventive and you can beat them in a certain way, one of my favorite things to do is to park a bunch of cars in front of a enemy spawn, blow them up and watch as my enemies die in a horrific, explosive manner. But sometimes these missions are some of the worse I have ever played in a game. Some require patience and trial-and-error attempts, but these missions feel almost never-ending, one after another as they get progressively longer and difficult. The final three missions are the worst for me, one in which you have to find and destroy these coffee stands that are peddling out drugs. This mission has a time limit and you have to find every stand, you don't get a marker or hint where they are at so you either have to do trial-and-error runs or just be a cheating bastard like me and search up a guide. The mission after that is the one where you have to drive to a pier to get this boat, then drive said boat near this landing strip, then blow up a plane with an RPG, retrieve the packages from said plane, then drive back to where you started the mission. Sounds like an exhilarating mission, but it's not. You have a timer and you get a four star wanted level after blowing up the plane, it is ruthless if you are playing the original version, the cops are dedicated and will stop at nothing in order to kill Claude. If it weren't for the controls it would be an easier and probably a good mission but sadly it's more trial-and-error bulls*it. The final mission you have to get $500,000 in order to even start but if you haven't been dying and getting arrested, it should be easy. They strip you of all your weapons, all of them you have worked so hard to get, all gone. Claude then has to shoot his way out of this cartel compound by picking up a pistol off the ground, you get other weapons after it's over but it doesn't end there. He has to follow this helicopter that leads to the dam where his ex-girlfriend is trying to escape from. You then have to shoot your way through hitscanning cartel members, all while avoiding rockets and this big truck that's trying to run you over. Then blow up the helicopter with an RPG and don't miss because if you do, you will probably fail due to you getting killed or the time limit running out. This mission throws everything at you and doesn't stop, it gets progressively harder and you have to use cheap tactics in order to win, that is if those tactics can even be done fast enough because of that stupid time limit. After the game ended, I was happy, knowing I will never play it again. How did I even beat this game when I was a kid? This is easily the hardest game I have ever beaten and most of the time, I was hating every tedious, frustrating, janky second.
Yeah, this game has not at all aged well. In some aspects it's commendable, but playing it nowadays is frustrating and makes you want to rip every hair out of your head. The definitive edition is even worse. The graphics are awful and has glitches galore. Not even the shooting or controls were fixed, you might as well play the original and mod it to make it way better. But sadly, you can't because now it's off steam so they can try to sucker in hardcore GTA fans to buy their failed remaster trilogy. What a joke. Do I recommend this game? Maybe, if you have patience unlike me and don't mind doing the same missions and just want to goof off.",1640114606,1640115209,False,3,0,0.514559328556060791,2,True,False,False,False,

Grand Theft Auto III is a hybrid game comprising driving, shooting, exploring, and in the truest sense, role-playing.

Players start as an nameless crook, who amidst a bank theft, is betrayed by his girlfriend, shot, and left for dead. As the ""kid,"" ""companion,"" or whatever your most recent supervisor chooses to allude to you as, you escape from the police through a secretive undeniable level quick in and out, and start life again with the assistance of your companion 8-Ball and the Italian Mafia. From that point, the game leads players through an odyssey of non-straight missions for different groups of organised crime, from the Italian to the Japanese mafia and so on. The 3D universe of Liberty City is on a scale that is really epic, comprising of three huge cities, the urban, industrial and suburban areas, each with proper engineering, scenes, and aggressive, distinctive AI.
What makes Grand Theft Auto III so different from other games in the series is the volume of characters, cut-scenes, and story embedded in virtually every mission, huge or little.

The games enormous potential, years ahead of it's time in technological terms, is coupled with level design and script of the lowest standard. The contrast between this is shocking to say at least. 

They could have handed it over to any random writer and still gotten a better result then the abomination that is GTA 3 script and missions. It's unbelievable how badly written/balanced this game is. The weakness of vehicles and the amount of suicide cops spawning is also something annoying that anyone should have caught in basic testing/balancing if any such events took place at all.

honest review:

playing this game was very enjoyable, and as a first ever entry to the GTA series we know and love today. it does hold up so much value! yes there are some bugs to this game and controls feel a bit weird but hey its a 2000s game and time was so different back then.. this game has a amazing story for our silent anime protagonist, the gun play was very enjoyable,  missions were a blast to run through even the side missions, and the sandbox was very fun to explore and drive around during those rainy days/nights.. this game is one of the all time CLASSICS for games.  
p.s.
i was one of the lucky ones to get this in a ""original trilogy collection"" many moons ago on sale. i feel bad for those that do want to play this game and cannot anymore because of stupid ass rockstar smh smh. honestly you are better just emulating this and finding mods to enjoy it much more. since this game is no longer on here,

I mean sure, there is corruption in the world, there is lots of crime and undoubtedly far too much drug-dealing, prostitution, cruelty, etc., etc. These things we get to read about in the newspaper, if not live out in our own little lives. They're not pleasant. So can these elements comprise a game? What happened to simply solving happy little puzzles, saving penguins, and receiving kisses from princesses?
Apparently, enough gameplayers and gamemakers have grown up to want something more in their games, and in the last four years videogames have grown. In Rockstar's fourth effort on PlayStation 2 (Midnight Club, Smuggler's Run, Oni), Grand Theft Auto III truly incorporates everything that its creators have strived for in a ""proper game"" since Take-Two created the upstart game division in 1998. In it, gamers have the chance to get dirty, to play the role of an ambitious, low-life criminal. The game is riddled with a breadth of goodies starting with the Mafioso rags-to-riches story, high-quality music, telling cut-scenes, and not ending with its giant, bristling, extraordinarily complex landscape.

What makes Grand Theft Auto III so much different and so brilliant in this third iteration is that while, with its huge scale, we might find familiar gameplay elements, the whole thing, the monstrous size and scope of the game, delivers something more than just the actual value of its parts. Having taken advantage of PS2's new technology to expand and develop their vision, the makers of Grand Theft Auto III have created a complete videogame experience like few, if any, before it.",1638032901,1638032901,True,2,0,0.503692746162414551,0,True,False,False,False,

Vehicles are made of paper mâché and blow up after a few bullets. Hostile NPCs are equipped with shotguns that can blow up your car in one hit. M16s capable of killing you in in less than a second even with body armor on.  The game has a very basic map, you cant set waypoints. And there is no way to view the full map in-game. And places such as a pay n spray do not appear unless you are playing a mission that requires you to respray the car. Saving the game doesn't restore your health. You must memorize where health pick ups are in the map because they are the only way to regain health.The game has very a low rending distance. If you turn around cars will disappear and npcs vanish. Which is problematic because if you are standing around gang territory, and turn your camera they can spawn behind you and start shooting. The spawn rates of hostiles is insane, you could be on an empty side walk and the next second there could be 4 gang bangers or like 6 Mafia members with shotguns going to insta-kill you. You can't lose the cops by saving either, but you can get around this by saving and then reloading your save. Pay n spray still removes wanted levels. The AI is so good at shooting that carrying a sniper rifle becomes almost manditory, because if the NPCs get too close they will tear you up if they have anything better than a pistol. You will find yourself running over people to finish frequently because it's the easiest way to kill a hostile. You will probably save after every mission because if you dont you might die to something janky like your car flipping over.

(Shout out to SilentP & GInput)

although original graphics are dated (ditto control scheme for PC) they are aesthetically pleasing, with the art style being consistant. The cutscenes in particular gripped me even after all these years and in my opinion the devs were correct in their stylistic choices & compromises with the cutscenes still holding well today (2021)

Although there are complaints with the PC Port they are reletivaly minor and somewhat able to be fixed or compensated for via mods.

If you have never played a grand theft auto and wish to start at the beginning... :p
 well this ain't it BUT it is much more approachable than GTA 1 or 2 & their expansions and is a good starting point to jump in. (Buy $$$)

If you have already played or finished GTA 3 then I would instead say wait for a sale unless you simply must finish your 'aughties retro' collection NOW.

The old game's graphics are way better than give way more detail to the game than the definitive edition does. It gives genuine ambiance and actually makes you feel as if you are playing the games as you were supposed to. All you need is a few mods that are free to get to fix the quirky stuff and that's it.

The original trilogy is something we all can agree is better than a dumb UE4 remaster made by some lazy devs.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] Another game where the binary ""yes/no"" of steam reviews really doesn't provide the right context.
[*] A landmark in open-world games and game development in general - though at this point, it's primarily a game worth playing for historical value or nostalgia. Many games (including Vice City and GTAIV) have taken what GTAIII did and refined/expanded it way beyond what GTAIII was possible of doing at the time of its release. This does not diminish its importance, but it does diminish its playability today.
[*] The latter third of the game is as bad and unfinished as it was when you were 13 - and with modern eyes, it's even worse.
[*] Though groundbreaking for its time, a modern player might be surprised at how empty GTAIII feels despite being lauded for all there is to do. You will be driving very long distances to the next missions. I can guarantee there are many streets in Liberty City that you have passed tons of times but never gone down because there's no reason to do so.
[*] That first third of the game is incredible on its own. The self-contained story of escape, success, and betrayal is the quintessential GTA story.

The story follows around Claude Speed, our silent protagonist, who has been betrayed and left for dead by his girlfriend, Catalina, the leader of the Colombian Cartel gang, which led to him being arrested by the police during a heist at the Liberty City Bank. Claude was released from imprisontment during the transfer, but he doesn't just stand still, he embarks on a quest for revenge that requires him to start over again being a lowly crook for a gang to gain a reputation and become a ""made-man"", but it instead leads him to be entangled in the world of crime, drugs, gang wars, corruption and even deeper betrayals with other gangs.
Overall, I enjoyed the storytelling of this game, the story of the game's simple, gritty themed, a lot of dark comedy, and with insane amount of betrayal, yep, almost all the characters in this game have trust issues, but that's the special thing about this game.
The characterization in this game is quite impressive, Rockstar can turn the mute Claude throughout the game into one of the most iconic characters in the GTA series, they made Claude a reliable right-hand man to do anything for anyone who can treat him well, he's also neutral, no background, and emotionless, making Claude the best mysterious character in the GTA series in story-wise (and also the saddest simp), besides that, they have also created paranoid and lustful version of Vito Corleone (Salvatore Leone), backstabber and ""ambitious"" crazy woman ( Catalina), political Hannibal Lecter (Donald Love), etc.
Lore-wise, to be honest, it's definitely inferior to the games I reviewed previously (Half-Life and Resident Evil Remastered) and other GTA games after, such as lesser myths, legends, lores, and lots of unexplored backstory, for example, GTA Vice City has around 140 creatures and people-type myths and legends while GTA III only has 17, but some of it is still tolerable, because GTA III itself is Rockstar's first open-world 3D game (It's obvious they're still experimenting with 3D universe storytelling on a simpe game engine) and the fanbase isn't as big as other GTA games after.

[h1]Gameplay 4,7/10[/h1]
 
Being a revolutionary game that standardizes the concept of open world adventure 3D video games, of course, the greatness of the gameplay of this 2001 game can't be doubted. You can walk, sprint, jump, attack and shoot people, buy guns and ammunitions, steal, drive, and blow up cars, repair and change the color of your car, carry out different types of enganging missions, have safehouses to save data, extensive and very exploreable map, get killed (not really), get arrested, and do other stuffs like a real human but in an immersive 3D simple third-person camera experience. Indeed Rockstar was really great at making this revolutionary game when the capabilities of the console engine was still very limited at the time despite the many features cut from the final game.
As all GTA fans have said, GTA III has been named the most difficult GTA game ever, the reasons are the absence of full map (only minimap), many missions and side missions that are really difficult, and some unbalanced weapon stats (the iconic M16 that has an insane rate of fire of 1800 RPM but Micro Uzi only has a rate of fire of 600 RPM), but as I said above, this is tolerable since GTA III itself is a predecessor games before other famous GTA games after a.k.a outdated.
I may have praised and criticized a lot above, but there's one thing that I hate the most about this game, especially this version of the game, which is the super annoying bugs that even Rockstar is careless to fix it, such as the ""deadly slippery floor"" when the player is running on an uneven surface, sometimes user interfaces becomes invisible, can't do 100% completion, the uncompletable loading when your game progress is high enough (the solution is to exit and enter the game with the Windows key without closing the game ). This is all really annoying, this game would one of the Rockstar's biggest sin along with the original Vice City and San Andreas on Steam if there were no mod fixes from the community itself.

[h1]Graphics 10/10[/h1]

In terms of graphics, this game is quite fantastic, able to compete with games released in the same year despite carrying open world adventure 3D gameplay and the limitations of the console engine at that time, an example of the ground-breaking advantages of this game at that time is the detailed damage of the vehicles, pretty realistic human motion animations, realistic gunfires, impactful effects, interactive puddles, weather system, different shades of the sky that represent the characteristics of each borough, the darkest theme among all GTA games etc. While the special advantages of the Steam (PC) version include smoothest graphics, best draw distance, up to 10 resolution screen resolution support ranging from 640 x 480 x 16 to 1920 x 1080 x 32, widescreen support, best number of FPS, realistic color grading (not too contrast), good entity design details (though not as good as the Xbox or mobile version) and the best gore system among all GTA games.
This is exactly where the initial popularization of the GTA series' iconic font called pricedown that's used in almost all user interfaces in this game, the popularization of the character's artworks used as menu or loading backgrounds, and the appropriate color selection, it already can be seen that the user interface in this game is indeed amazing to the point it's used as a user interface benchmark for every GTA games after.

[h1]Sounds 9,9/10[/h1] 

Rockstar never disappoints me when it comes to soundtracks, for GTA III theme itself, it's number 4 of my favorite GTA theme, before Liberty City Stories, IV, and San Andreas. The radio stations here are also very good, my favorites are Double Clef FM (Italian classical), Rise FM (trance), and Flashback FM (80s pop). 
Relating to voice acting, like GTA games after that, Rockstar is willing to pay a high price for the quality of their voice actors, and that's really great, examples of famous Hollywood actors who voiced in GTA III include Frank Vincent (voice actor Salvatore Leone), Debi Mazar (voice actor Maria Latore), Robert Loggia (voice actor Ray Machowski) etc. Non-Hollywood voice actors are great too, like Guru (8-Ball voice actor), Lazlow (Lazlow voice actor, himself) etc.
But there's a problem where sometimes the pedestrians' voices is cut off by a second, therefore, some pedestrians' voices became unclear to hear, especially the normal pedestrians' (non-gang and non-authority)

[h1]Replayablity 9/10[/h1]

In addition to story missions, there are other missions that you can do after completing this game to reach 100% completion, ranging from the hardest to the easiest, specifically vehicle missions, off-road missions, phone missions, rampages, unique jumps, import/ export, hidden packages, and RC vehicle missions, however, because there's a bug that makes us unable to reach 100% completion, namely stuck at 99%, more precisely in one of the unique jumps in Shoreside Vale, it's annoying, but don't think too much about it since we also won't get anything at 100% completion anyway (satisfaction only), but there are some mission rewards that will be very useful for your playthrough such as vehicle missions, hidden packages, and import/ export.
There are also 22 cheat codes that you can activate to have fun with the game, but they're definitely fewer in number than the GTA games after, as it lacks well-known cheats such as the armor cheat, infinite cheat, and anti-wanted cheat.

[h1]Overall 8,5/10[/h1]

[b]About the game[/b]

During my first play, I thought this game wasn't good enough as the other two. In part, I'm kinda right, because the next games changed most of the things and made it better. But then I release that maybe a second chance couldn't be so bad. In fact, I enjoyed my second play, also I completed some missions I missed in my first play, and then I found this was very addicting. Not only the game-play itself is easy (because at some point, the practice will make the game easier), the missions are also pretty challenging, and at some point very fun.

If we talk about the story and the characters... this is just about going to a place, listen to our boss, and then do the task, but the characters aren't that annoying, even some of them are really cool, such as Asuka Kasen or Donald Love. It is not a Robert de Niro movie with a complex story and complex characters, but the action compensates those flaws, and then you find how good the game is.

In conclusion, it's a game in the series you can't miss. Of course it's not Vice City nor San Andreas, but it's a challenging game that will make you yell 'cause of the emotion! I recommend it... of course, if Rockstar releases the game again...

[b]About this PC port[/b]

It's important to you to know that you're going to purchase a PC version of this game. The original one is from PS2, and if you ask me, you may want to think twice, because this PC port isn't that good. For some reason Rockstar delivered a broken port, and hell, they didn't try to make it compatible with new hardware, so you can't play with widescreen support and you may want to play at 800x600 resolution. And not only that, the graphics are corrupted with this 1.1 version, and it's better that you downgrade to 1.0.

Many PS2 features are missing in this PC port, there is no newer hardware support, and the new ""definitive edition"" doesn't help, because they're broken too. So, the only fix to this big problem, is modding the game, and yet, you may feel that some things SHOULD be here in this PC version. It's up to you to purchase this gross port.

I understand making a review for this game is kind of moot considering that it's delisted from Steam, but I still would like to give my thoughts on the game in case they remain any relevant to or are challenged by the supposed Trilogy Remastered version, and maybe inspire some people to take a GTA game for a spin for once

In this game, we follow our new, silent protagonist ""Claude"" through his misadventures as an fugitive turned hired gun in Liberty City, (which is a parody of New York City, and is also called the ""worst place in America"", so take that commentary as you will), looking for a way to make a killing again, and get revenge on his ex-girlfriend that betrayed him and left him to take the fall for a robbery of the Bank of Liberty City.

Now, onto the actual review, I don't think this game is any good at all if you don't already like GTA from one of the better games. It's easily the worst ""modern"" GTA in terms of writing, game design, narrative, etc, to the point where people consider GTA Vice City to be the real GTA 3. But, I'll lay out the pros and cons for playing such a cursed game:

[h1] What am I getting into with GTA 3? [/h1]
+ Good worldbuilding and characters, in GTA 3 the universe is as crude as crude can be. Everyone is basically a maniac or incredibly cold in what they do, yet they all come off as a badass, or somehow comedic, or just plain stupid, or in some cases all of the above, and you'll probably end up enjoying most if not all of them for it because this game series is known for making legendary anti-heroes you can't help but love.
+ Good continuity as always, you meet a lot of characters from the prequel games like GTA LCS and GTA VC like Donald Love (VC), Toni Cipriani (LCS), Salvatore Leone (LCS), etc. The Forellis are a part of Leone side of missions, which is important to note for VC as well. Even Claude and Catalina's first in-universe appearances were in 1992, in GTA San Andreas.
+ Good licensed music as always, but GTA 3 specifically has the best radio station in all of GTA in Moving Shadow Radio (MSX FM).
+ Needless to say, you get to kill people and blow stuff up, it's awesome.

[h1] What's so bad about GTA 3? [/h1]
- Silent and underdeveloped protagonist leaves us with the a lack of a main character for no good reason, and a lot of dialogue to the player is also awkward because it HAS to be all one-sided. The game keeps its composure despite this, but good lord it makes the whole game feel like fetch quests and not like you're actually doing something for yourself like VC/SA.
- Game design is really scuffed in a lot of ways; minimap is not very detailed. No expandable in-game map like future GTA games, no map blips during missions, some very important blips do not appear at all such as Ammu-Nation stores.
- Game lacks a lot of things to do in general; you're almost always just doing jobs to progress the plot, there's not much else to do in terms of side missions, finding collectibles and looking at the map. The urban setting is nice but you don't buy this game to look at street corners all day. Money is also really shallow; missions give you a bunch, but no customization or anything to spend it on, you're only using your money to buy more guns and ammo, which you can never spend too much on.
- Game balancing and mission difficulty sucks half the time. I wouldn't have beaten this game without using cheats for the last 1/3rd, that's how bad some of the balancing gets. Lots of the mission difficulty assumes you know what the hell you're doing on a mission you've never done before; a lot of these missions you have to play them multiple times to complete because 1 mistake can ruin it all for you. Retrying is also pretty tedious. I could write an essay on everything wrong in this regard, but it ultimately comes down to poor/no standards in the early 2000s.
- Standalone story writing and narrative is nearly nonexistent compared to the other 3D trilogy games, or requires playing the other 3D trilogy games or the prequel to understand. I think this stems from a myriad of issues and I could write a full essay on this too, but I'm not going to do that here. I'll just let you know that GTA games start getting real logical story in Vice City, not here.

I may be biased, but regardless of all this, I'll still give this game a thumbs up, because it has its own charm and each GTA game feels more and more like a part of a whole rather than a standalone game the more you play into the series, and MSX FM is just too good to not recommend.",1634714259,1635427021,True,2,0,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,False,False,

GTA III is my 2nd favourite game of all time (behind Flashback on Mega Drive).

It's sad that a lot of younger people will never know how big a deal this game was leading up to its release.

For me it was the best example of how to take advantage of a new generation of video game consoles and make a worthy numbered followup.

GTA III took the foundations that were GTA 1 & GTA 2 and doubled down. It was my most anticipated game of 2001.

The freedom was GTA III's major selling point.
""You don't have to do any of the missions""
""You can go where you like""
""You can do whatever you want""
The pitch was you had a fully-rendered 3D city to explore. That was the draw -- the appeal. There were little to no games like it at the time. It was revolutionary.

I'll use an example.

Sleeping Dogs, a cult favourite, wouldn't exist without the True Crime series, and those games wouldn't exist without GTA III's very existence.

Saints Row is getting a reboot as I write this review. That series was made at a time where there was no new GTA title. Saints Row 1 was clearly inspired by San Andreas, which was the series swansong for that generation. It took everything GTA III and Vice City had an perfected it. Open world games today would never play the way they do without GTA III's influence. GTA III inspired a generation of games and arguably revolutionised the open-world genre in general.

I have a lot of respect for GTA III.

Sure, it's nowhere near as cram-filled full of things to do as later games in the series, but it paved the way, and to those people who are complaining that there is no GTA VI being announced and regard GTA III as the worst in the series; do yourself a favour and put yourself in the shoes of someone living in 2001 and think to yourself ""it'll never get better than this"", because it did, and you have GTA III to thank for it.

It's impressive how alive Liberty City feels despite this game turning 20 this year.
Between the original version on Ps2, the Ps3 and Ps4 ports, the iOS one and the Steam version i might have spent around 3000 hours playing it, speedrunning it and modding it installing all sorts of stuff. Now, is that good for you? Probably not, was that fun? Damn straight.
A revolutionary game that has accompanied me throughout my life, knowing that it will stop being sold digitally at some point during the next three months saddens me, the original versions of the main Ps2 era GTA trilogy should always be preserved, They are an integral part of gaming history, and seeing them being completely replaced by the Definitive Edition feels wrong.

I get that this means there are a few things that aren't gong to be as polished as they became for later titles. However, this game's driving mechanics are HORRENDOUS. First, the hitboxes for vehicles and objects are much larger than the models are. This often leads to situations where you're going at high speed for any number of reasons and you see a slight gap between two vehicles/objects that looks big enough to drive through. WRONG! Even thought the asset models don't touch each other, the game still counts it as a collision. Second, these vehicles are incredibly fragile. Most fall apart after a few hits. Third, there are simultaneously very few vehicles and too many vehicles on the road. I do not now how that is possible, but this game manages it. You don't really notice this third thing until you are unfortunate enough to get to one of this game's racing/time trial sections. These elements aren't so bad individually, but taken together, they add up to a very frustrating experience. I could ignore all of this if the missions focused more on combat ore something and, to be fair, the first part of the game does for the most part. However, there are tons and tons of racing/time trial missions which force you to engage with these shitty mechanics under a time constraint that is way too strict considering how terrible the driving is. A lot of these missions also drag on for way too long for how little time they give you to complete them. 

There's one fairly early on where you have to collect magazines that are falling out of the back of a van and you have to follow the trail of magazines to find the van. You have to use another top-heavy van that tips over and spins out constantly to collect the magazines on the trail and are given 25 seconds to find the van where they are falling out of. Each one you collect gives you +1 second to your timer. Despite this short timer, this game has you drive all over the first section of the map (for those who haven't played this yet, the map is divided into three islands). With the crappy driving mechanics that I mentioned above, this mission really starts to test your patience. The racing/time trial missions only get worse from there. 

I played this back on the PS2 and forgot how much I hated the driving. I also forgot just how much of this game forces you to interact with its worst elements. Aside from this though, the rest of the game is actually still pretty good. However, with how bad the racing/time trial missions are and how many of these missions there are, I cannot recommend buying this game. Only buy this if you have the patience to deal with bad driving mechanics for extended periods of time.",1632893761,1632893761,False,1,0,0.481865286827087402,0,True,False,False,False,

It was revolutionary for the time, however, it has not aged well and there isn't much to it that new GTA titles don't have. I played this game partially for nostalgia, and partially because I found a collection of mods that remaster the 3D era games (while still remaining vanilla) to look sharper and work on modern hardware.

In Grand Theft Auto III, you take control of Claude, a long time gangster who is betrayed by his girlfriend Catalina, who shoots him and leaves him to die. You survive, and go working for various mobsters. The game TRIES to have a plot, story, and characters, but almost nobody is fleshed out. Claude is mute, and has almost no character. There are examples of mute characters that work out well, like Gordon Freeman from Half Life, but this is not that case. I did not feel like I was immersed in the role of Claude, nor did he feel relatable in any way. He is simply an empty character that interacts with mostly empty characters.

The graphics and gameplay aren't bad. You have to keep in mind this is a game from 2001, and was one of the first of it's kind. As I said though, graphics and gameplay only get this game so far, when anybody has the option of playing later titles in the series.

Overall, I'll give this game a 6/10. Would be 5/10, but I'll give it an extra point for nostalgia and history. If you absolutely want to go back and play this, go ahead, but in general, I would suggest skipping this and moving on to either Vice City or SA.",1631826534,1631826534,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Coming out in 2001 the game is still fun to come back and reminiscence of the good ol days of blocky textures, wacky animations, arcadey gameplay and overall basics of a game of that time frame. The game is rather short and small but for it's time it is mad impressive what a developer could do coming from the Top-Down gameplay of GTA 1 and GTA 2. The same concept of those past two games has stayed the same yet with the aspect of a 3D world. 

Note: I did have to install a few mod's to make the game enjoyable as the steam version does have a few issues. There are plenty of guides on how to install them here on steam.

Story wise it lacks in length as I was able to complete it in a mere couple hours. However looking back I could've done the side stuff for a few bonuses. It's not my first time playing it either so that also could account in how I was able to beat it in such time. Gameplay was simple enough yet was a little unforgiving gunfight wise. I found myself failing missions here and there, mainly when it involved the police (May I say the police in this game are BRUTAL). Countless times I was almost in a panic as the cops tried to ram me off the road constantly. Some of the gunfights with the enemies felt rewarding as it required you to be cautious as your HP/Armor can be shredded in a mere few bursts of gunshots, so over exposing yourself in fights was definitely a no go. 

Overall there really isn't much to GTA III other then it set a very great and very high expectation goal for other game developers. Including itself. Almost cementing itself as one of the reasons why we have such good games now.

Play it if you want to experience the first 3D open world game, to see what worked, and what didn't, and how it started a genre. Fun fact, with the camera angles, you can play this game entirely in isometric view to play like GTA 1 and 2, if you wanted. I played most of it in the standard third person perspective.

 like i was texting someone and didnt pause the game and randomly some girls looking in the car im like what?? must be a glitch whatever but then she gets in and im like wait a sec what

after some driving and finding a secluded spot voila free health pretty much what a great innovation 

if only gta 6 came out and gta online/red dead online wasnt such a cash grab its really too bad 

i miss lazlow and dan houser but its no suprise seeing what direction the company was going i hope they create something instead something like the glory days even a gta 4 clone i would love re skin and re vamp the online of that who cares anything but shark cards and gold

sorry i started ranting i really love gta 3, vice city, gta 4, vice city stories,san andreas and even sometimes i like gta 5 and red dead1 and 2 obviously i love the games i have to play them its just i miss the feeling i got when i played vice city for the first time in awhile it was awesome

i started watching all these mob movies and stuff and prolly gonna re watch scarface but really the atmosphere and music its all amazing 

no edm and boom booom crap for me rn sorry theres just something about the vibes those games give idk its just not the same it makes me sad but yeah anyways

So first of all you only have a small mini map and other than that you have to rely solely on your memory to know where everything is, for example to lose the police you have to know the locations of pick ups which lower your heat level and these are not shown on the mini map. Secondly I found the missions to be frustrating as there is no checkpoints and the objectives can be annoying such as the mission ""Taking Out the Laundry"" in which the player is tasked with destroying 3 moving vans and is given grenades.

Claude's silent emotionless face torments my nightmares to this day. Some of the missions in this game made me feel genuine despair. Like, this one where you have to find and destroy 8 vending machines serving something called 'SPANK' in 7 minutes. Or another, where you have to get on a boat (something that is extremely difficult due to the physics and the fact that if you fall in the water of Liberty City you almost immediately drown) and use a rocket launcher to shoot down an extremely fast airplane. 

The mission design in this game is the bane of my existence. That, on top of the terrible free aim, nearly non-existent camera controls when driving a car or using lock on, and the fact the slightest bump, or a turn that's a little bit too sharp will cause your car to flip over and explode made me lose sleep over this game. The countless nights where I was up at 7 am struggling to complete a mission.

Not to mention that the game forces you to play at 30 fps, or else it will be a buggy mess. Which shouldn't be a problem for some people, but I'm sure for others it's a deal-breaker. The story is nearly nonexistent, as, for some reason it centers around Claude. a silent protagonist's, quest for revenge on his now ex-girlfriend Catalina. Almost every cutscene consists of 

Claude walks in

""Oh! It's you! I work for (Criminal organization), and I need you to do some work for me! Do it!""

Claude leaves.

So that's certainly a mission setup.
I should mention, that by the end of the game I had almost 2 million dollars, yet there's really nothing to spend said 2 million dollars. There's no properties and assets and whatnot to purchase, like in Vice City. There's no cool outfits and stuff to buy like in San Andreas. No vehicles and properties or stocks like in GTA V. (Leaving out 4 because I don't remember there being much to buy post game either). You just kind of have a bunch of money for the sake of having money. Maybe to refill your arsenal every time you die or get busted (and getting busted in these 3D era games is painfully easy, so prepare to do it a lot. I mean, I eat explosions with a side of bullets for breakfast lunch and dinner why does one officer pointing a pistol at me make me instantly surrender this is cruel and unusual)

Oh, also the M16. It might be one of the most absurdly overpowered weapons in Grand Theft Auto history. The enemies in this game actually have like, aimbot tier aim. And with the M16 (Which can shoot all 60 bullets in like, under a second) you are bound to get wiped off the face of this earth and deleted, even at full heath and armor, in maybe 2 seconds. Sometimes I'd turn a corner and be dead before I could even think to look up at my health.

Also there's no map, which sucks because I have the memory of a sentient acorn so I could never memorize the map. 
I probably left out some stuff but that's the gist of it.

That being said, I enjoyed this game and I will be doing a second playthrough. 10/10.",1627955195,1627955195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

[b] Playthrough Length - [/b] 8.9 hours

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b] 2.0/10, 5.0/10
[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b] 7.0/10
[b] Soundtrack: [/b] 7.0/10
[b] Graphics: [/b] 3/10 (It came out in 2001, so this doesn't really count)
[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b] 5.0/10, 5.0/10

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b]
There isn't a plot. And the game only connects what happens at the beginning of the game at the end of the game. The entire middle part is filler when it comes to the greater  gameplay. The dialogue is pretty mediocre all things considered, nothing I remembered all too well. 

[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]
The setting of Liberty City is done pretty well with a nice and open map. There is plenty for you to explore and it really does feel like New York City, so good job on that regard. 

[b] Soundtrack: [/b]
The radio stations in this game are the only music you'll find, except for the end credits. The radio stations are pretty good with their own variety and vibe to them, so you'll find what you like. I liked Flashback 95.6 the most and Jah Radio. 

[b] Graphics: [/b] 
The graphics are pretty bad but this game came out in 2001, so I can't really knock it for that reason. 

[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b] 
The gameplay is weird on PC, as it seems that you cannot shoot while in a car. A lot of the guns in the game force you to remain stationary, when it does not make much sense for that to happen. Enemies die pretty fast to most weapons. Car driving is surprisingly good and holds up pretty well to this day. One annoying aspect is that if your car flips and lands on the roof, it will automatically catch on fire, forcing you to run out of there. There are additional phone missions besides the main missions and you can collect hidden packages around the map, which offers a good amount of replayability. 

The sound design is average, it's kinda funky at some times but it holds up alright for a majority of it.

[b] Final Notes: [/b]
This game was pretty revolutionary when it came out, going from 2D to 3D for the first time in the GTA franchise. Rockstar was clearly in its infancy when it comes to telling stories and I believe this was mostly a test to see if Rockstar could work with the new engine, and they definitely did. The game does not hold up too well to today's standards, especially when compared to games like Halo: Combat Evolved and Half-Life. This is still a good game to play and I recommend it if you don't have anything else to do.",1627755220,1627755271,True,0,0,0.465711385011672974,0,True,False,False,False,

Good:
+ Reasonable and absolutely worthwhile price for such a iconic game. A must buy in my opinion!
+ One of the oldest memories I have of any video games, which makes it a truly special game in my own eyes just because of that, even though it's gotten quite old and outdated obviously.
+ Even though the protagonist ""Claude"" never spoke, the story still managed to be fairly interesting. Especially when you got such big names as voice actors playing cool characters (Frank Vincent from The Sopranos and Goodfellas, Joe Pantoliano from Matrix, Michael Madsen from Reservoir Dogs among other individuals).
+ Radio stations which became a thing in the later games. Not sure if it was first tested in this game but I imagine it was. Great songs available but few though (more on that in the bad section).
+ Hidden packages and side missions that can give you some gameplay advantages if needed and if that's your thing.
+ Some funny dialogues from peds and characters throughout the game, which made me laugh a bit.
+ Gloomy and dark atmosphere which sets the environment perfect for the conversations and tasks you have to do.

Neutral:
+-  A bit unstable when playing over 30 fps as far as I've read over several threads and experienced myself. I've been quite comfortable with the 30 capped fps because of how it doesn't really feel like 30 fps, at least in my own personal experience. You decide yourself if you can play as it is, otherwise there might be fixes for you available that people have manage to create. But I can't say for sure.

Bad:
- Cars blowing up way too fast and too easy. The cars can barely take a beating and so they'll catch fire in a sec after a crash or two.
- Lack of variety of vehicles like in the later games. No bikes, no helicopters and only one sort of plane that you can't really control in a traditional way because of the ""learning curve"" of managing the plane.
- Claude can't swim. Come on, man. Why you have to be like this?
- Lack of songs on the radio stations. It gets fast repetitive, even with the great songs available unfortunately.

This game, while not having the quality of life improvements the following Rockstar games have, this game is still a blast. The story, while not as big as other games from Rockstar, still has a great story which is still as enjoyable as Red Dead Redemption 2's. The storyline is dark and has amazing writing from Rockstar.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]

You can't aim and I had to use re3 to look around with the mouse in a vehicle. The Dodo plane, the only plane you can fly, is a chore to control. You can't swim, so getting out of the boats in this game is scary at times, and some missions are so unfair I had to use cheats. Also, the Pay 'n Sprays are not marked on the map so you have to memorize where they are, which aren't hard with the small map of Liberty City. With the negatives out of the way, I love the gameplay. Cars are so fun to use, so are the boats, and the top-down camera calling back to GTA 1 and 2 is a nice feature. Flying tanks are awesome, and the cheats are so fun to use.

Being Rockstar's first foray into 3D games, the missions here can feel a bit arcade-y at times. You'll have time limits, a lot of missions will involve just you going to a place, or taking a character some place. The missions here can be pretty difficult as the shooting is a bit archaic, and your health drains insanely fast. For a new fan of the GTA series, there are a few annoyances here and there—dying during a mission is a retry with no checkpoints, you lose all of your weapons and have to repurchase, the driving and physics aren't the best.

All of that being said, I enjoyed my time with this game. Once you overlook all of the ""errors"" of this being a game from 2001, it can be pretty enjoyable and fun. If you're a fan of new GTA who's curious, definitely give it a try. It's not very long, and pretty cheap too; goes on sale often. The entire game took me 15 hours.

Another side note is that this game was designed for Windows XP, and has a bit of trouble running on newer versions of the Windows OS.

I was really looking forward to playing GTA III after playing a little bit of GTA IV and enjoyed it for what it is. Unfortunately this is pretty much a product of it's time and is extremely hard. There is still some enjoyment to be had here, though I'd say it's only for hardcore GTA fans. 

The beginning starts off great. The Atmosphere and Cityscape is fantastic, but by mid-game GTA III begins to dwindle in quality. Missions become extremely tedious and revolves around luck more than skill. Seriously, having a mission were certain NPC's die for no reason or a certain car that's critical for a mission blowing up for no godd*mn reason is a complete mission restart. Any slight screw up and it's a complete mission restart. Not going in the direction that the developers intended you to go but doesn't tell you, a complete mission restart. Going down a street and have some rando blow your car up with a shotgun and kills you during a mission. Guess what now? That's right, a complete mission restart.

There's no telling how many times I felt like ripping my tits off or finding a way to literally Fu*k Myself for how frustrating and hard these missions are in this game. If you're looking to play this game after playing something like GTA IV or V, be prepared to die a lot and be doing a lot of mission restarts.

I would only recommend this game to die-hard fans of the GTA series.

As for newcomers, I would say give GTA III a pass and either play Vice City or San Andreas instead. If you like either one of these games, then you can probably give GTA III a try.

The physics and combat are atrocious at times, making the latter half of the game a slog to get through. Eventually the missions become so long and repetitive that they are not fun anymore, but you need to beat them to progress on to other parts of the map, so you just repeat them over and over until you can execute them 100% perfectly.

POSITIVES:
- Gameplay is pretty fun. If you're not doing any missions you can waste time killing peds/cops and blowing up helicopters until the army shows up. Those M16's drop your health from 100 to 0 in a matter of 3 seconds. So much so that the community never realized they had dialogue simply because of how quickly they gun you down.
-Soundtrack is my top favorite element of this game. Listening to radio stations like Lips 106, Head Radio & Double Cleff FM give me Season 1 Sopranos vibes, especially driving through Little Italy. By far my favorite radio station has to be hands down MSX FM. Thanks to this station my love for Drum & Bass from the early 2000's has been within me to this day. 
- Driving through Liberty City feels nice but mostly during daytime. My favorite districts have to be Portland & Staunton. Portland being a small commune area where most activities is dock working, construction in the suburbs and the red light district where things tend to go interestingly discreet. 
- Voice acting is superb. For 2001 the performance of the famous actor like Michael Madsen, Frank Vincent, Michael Rapaport and other did an amazing job portaying their respective characters despite the mission cutscenes being short & to the point. 

NEGATIVES:
- The plot of Grand Theft Auto III doesn't feel much like a story worth going after. It's just a small revenge story that doesn't go anywhere until way later in the game when Catalina makes very small appearances and. Everything else is just the classic formula from the first two Grand Theft Auto Games. Meet this guy, do this job, mission complete. The only difference is that in GTA 1 & 2 your bosses are mostly giving you missions through payphones whereas in III you meet them in person instead through the cutscenes. The ending is pretty mixed. Catalina's death wasn't much to remember just blow up her helicopter. I did like the relaxing tune as the news reports the events of the final mission. However i never understood what the hell happened to Maria? Did Claude kill her for being annoying? or as the rumors say it was an audio oopsie from Rockstar's part?

- Many of the missions are incredibly difficult and/or just a waste of time. A big portion of the game's missions are time based and it's really annoying since you have to worry about not making any mistakes otherwise game over. On the wasting time part, the first mission for Ray Machowski is Claude driving in circles all over staunton picking up payphones before you hear Ray's stupid audio recorder to pick up yet another phone. Until he eventually tells you where to meet him. Wouldn't it be easier if Claude could just do a big favor for Ray that way he could've earned his trust? That was the stupidest mission in the game. I read that the reason why these missions were so difficult was because of gameplay padding. I'm glad this isn't the case anymore. 

-Police AI is all over the place. This is another thing that made missions very difficult for me in this game. It seems the LCPD consists of human officers with the mentality of a raging bull. They may ride around in small cruisers, but i swear those lame cop cars are just as fast if not faster that a cheetah. One bump of a police car and you'll be sent spinning around the road and either end up in the ocean or your vehicle flipped over exploding in the process. 

I understand that without this game all the other installments in the series wouldn't have existed along with other similar games like Saints Row, however this game simply didn't age well and it's difficulty really drove me away from it. As soon as I completed the story and the side missions I had no reason to come back to it.

SPOILERS!!!!
Wow where do I begin with this monstrosity of a ""video game""? Look, I get that this was the first open world do whatever the hell you want game in existence that released on the Playstation 2 and Original Xbox, but man this game made me realize that people back then didn't have SHIT in their video games. Like honestly, this game is held for its goundbreaking technology and advancements in gaming, but there is literally nothing more than driving mediocre controls and shooting 6 different weapons. The world is so dead, the AI is somewhat better than Cyberpunk, the story is god awful, and everything is forgettable in this game. The story? What fucking story, it's nonexistent. All you really get told is that you get backstabbed by two Cartel members, one is an ex-girlfriend, and then you just start working for the Mob's Capo right off the bat. That is some terrible starting position for a story. There is no grind or sense of achievement in the story whatsoever, you just do random dirty work for criminals with no real explanation. You betray major characters more than once for no real reason, and you don't have a real goal for a mass majority of the game. Once you're through with 90% of the game, you find yourself with one true goal... Revenge (lol).

Play this if you want to experience a boring and outdated video game that doesn't hold up to todays standards, but to experience the stepping stones that rockstar laid out for the gaming industry that we all know today. Lol

The first full 3D Grand Theft Auto game, GTA III puts you in the shoes of Claude as you enter a world of crime, drugs, gang warfare, and corruption. My man Claude doesn't speak but that's fine. Makes him all so much more enjoyable as he litterly can't say anything that would upset people. Your basically a puppet running from mission to mission shooting people and collecting money to buy better guns to shoot more people with. The story is fine and it's fun to explore Liberty City. When I first played this game I couldn't believe its the same city that number 4 plays off in but I then learned it plays a rather big roll in pretty much all the GTA games. As far as GTA games go, number III is a classic. I did die a lot but I always got back up to kick ass all over again. Fun fact - the radio station Flashback FM only got 5 songs, but they are all from the movie Scarface - I loved that.

The menus don't display text, the resolution is weird, it crashes, and many other problems. Most of these issues can be fixed with the ""Classic Enhanced"" mod pack, but Rockstar really shouldn't be selling a product that requires mods to work.

Secondly, this game just hasn't aged very well. There are a lot of annoyances and missing features that make playing it today just not as good as it could be. One of the biggest of these is that there is no map screen, so you basically have to memorize the layout of the map from driving around. Also, the stores like Ammunation and the spray shop don't show up on the minimap, so finding them can be really tricky. Whenever you die or are busted by cops you lose all of your weapons, and if you die ore are busted during a mission you have to drive all the way back to the mission start point. Also there is no 'quit mission' option, so if you want to do this the only way I know of is committing self kill.

I played about 10% of the missions before calling it quits.

GTA-3 is the first 3D game of the entire franchise with a protagonist and a sequal to GTA:Sanandreas.Gameplay is lot more different from GTA-2 and london series which are top-down perspective view games.This is the first GTA game with introduction to cutscenes ,voiceacting,sidemissions and hidden packages etc.Gameplay and plot is good but there are bugs which are not fixed and can be fixed with available mods by installing it.

Completed 100% of the game which includes extra content besides main missions.For completionists it may take time to locate all the collectables as it might be difficult  at the first glance of the area but still possible which depends upon individual .Overall introduction to 3D environment of the franchise with many non existing features compared to previous series made gameplay more different.

Things that are implemented poorly:
- Proper controller support.
- a map where you can see your character in the pause menu like in vice city or san andreas. This means you can only see things on the radar in your immediate vicinity.
- Camera movement / manipulation is garbage.
- Steering of vehicles is poor even compared to other gta games of the era.
- Some missions are extremely difficult if not done at the start of the game. E.g. trying to do the ambulance missions after youve completed the game will end up in you being blown up by the mafia, triads, columbians etc.

It’s crime-focused open world revolutionized gaming forever, setting the template for future open world games. However, it’s been nearly 20 years since the game was released. Has it held up?

Driving is simple, but effective. Controls are easy to use with KB+M and most cars are not slippery, so driving around town and getting from point A to point B is simple. It’s nothing special, but it works. Car physics are very arcadey, though, so realism fans will need to adjust to how III’s cars work.

The most notable thing about driving isn’t the driving controls or handling, but how little damage vehicles can take. Regular cars take a surprisingly small amount of damage before the engine starts going up in flames, while sports cars feel like they’re made out of paper. The only cars that have the durability you expect in later games are the heavier ones. This is a double-edged sword; while this means enemies can destroy you easily in cars, this also means you can shred enemy vehicles with ease. It adds an interesting risk/reward to drive-bys and missions with combat.

Boat handling is good, but the big problem is that you can’t do drive-bys with them. This makes dealing with other boats awkward, as you can’t fire back if they’re on you, unlike with cars. All you can do is outpace them or, if it’s a mission, follow them until you can hit them for a pitiful amount of damage. 

Combat is basic. Your character fires in the direction the cursor is pointing at without any fancy over-the-shoulder camera or zoom in that you see in later GTA games or in modern third person shooters. It’s very primitive, but the game’s AI is extremely stupid, so killing them isn’t a problem.

The weapons are also barebones. The only exotic weapons you have are the Flamethrower and Rocket Launcher, with every other weapon being a grenade, pistol, SMG, or assault rifle. This doesn’t mean your weapon selection sucks, because several of your weapons are lethal as hell.  

Interestingly, you can carry every weapon at once, unlike later GTA games. This is overkill for the most part, as the Mini-Uzi, Shotgun, Grenades, M16, and Rocket Launcher tower over the other weapons, but it’s nice to have some extra gear to mix things up or if you’re out of ammo for them.

The world map is great…with one big exception. The first two areas, Portland and Staunton Island, are very well-connected with several side-paths.  The areas are also small enough that you can easily memorize the areas and create your own routes for things like Paramedic or evading the police without too much trouble. Fans of San Andreas and onwards will be disappointed, but it’s refreshing having a world small enough to work with and plan around with ease.

Shoreside Vale is the final area and is easily the worst one out of all the areas. The area has far poorer interconnection compared to the rest of the map, making navigation a chore at times. For an example, the area is divided into two sections via a river.  There are only two bridges (well, one bridge and one dam) that connect each side, so your options for crossing from one side to another is very limited. And, since the only aerial vehicle is a gimmicky plane and there are no boats, your options are limited to just those bridges all the time. There are also a lot of dead ends that make traveling more of a pain. Most of the map is underused in missions, so at least half of the area feels almost pointless. The only real interesting area is the airport, which takes up a surprisingly large chunk of the island for little benefit. It feels very rushed and incomplete compared to the previous locations. It’s a shame, because if Shoreside Vale was as good as the other two areas, GTA III would have the best map in the series.

There is one major issue with the map; as you progress through the game, gangs that prowl a region will become permanently hostile once you do a certain mission. This is a particular problem with one area, where a Shotgun-wielding gang will become hostile and will destroy your vehicle in seconds if they see you. To make things worse, you will anger 7 out of 9 gangs in the game if you complete all of the game’s missions and make one gang that always aggros on you be given powerful AK-47s after the final mission. This “feature” makes travel and enjoying the sandbox troublesome the further you get into the game, as driving through certain neighborhoods can make your car go from 100% to critical health in no time due to gangs going nuts and opening fire the moment they see you. Having to plan around avoiding several areas in a sandbox game is pretty dumb.

Even worse, hostile gangs make activities such as Paramedic and Firefighter very difficult, as the game will make you go to areas filled with a hostile gang that will shoot up your vehicle. This means that, if you’re going for 100%, you have to do side missions as soon as possible or else they’ll become very difficult to outright impossible because of enemy gangs.

The missions are much simpler than in other GTA games. Minigames are non-existent and gimmicks like “spook-o-meters” appear very few times. Instead, you spend most missions doing basic things like driving to certain locations to kill someone, getting a certain wanted level and evading the police, or collecting objects. It’s all barebones, but feels oddly refreshing in that you don’t have to deal with any dumb minigames or gmiccks.

The great thing about III’s missions is how open they are. Many missions are open enough to let you tackle missions how you want instead of exactly how the designers want. For example, there is a mission that requires you to hit a car until it’s dropped six pieces of evidence, then destroy the car used to collect the evidence. Instead, you can get into a tank and blow up the vehicle with a shot from the tank’s cannon, instantly completing the mission. Being able to handle missions, including some difficult ones, how you want to makes going through missions more fun and memorable than nonsensical railroading you see in later GTA games.

One big problem with the game is that money is essentially worthless in this game. Weapon shops have a limited stock and Hidden Packages make free weapons spawn at every safehouse in the game, so blowing cash on weapons is pointless except if you really, really need a certain weapon that is only gained from Hidden Packages in the final island but can be bought in the second one. There are no purchasable safehouses nor properties, so there’s no huge money sink in the game. The only other thing you can spend money on is Pay ‘n Sprays, but after a few missions or some Hidden Package hunting early in the game, you’ll have all you need to afford Pay ‘n Sprays for the entire game. It seems the developers intended money to be treated more like score than money, like how it was treated in earlier GTA games, but III isn’t a score attack game or is there a high score board. 

Grand Theft Auto III is an unusual game; it launched the GTA series into the mainstream and kickstarted the modern open world genre, but it has its own quirks that make it stand out from the games that came after it. Compared to later GTA games, it feels like a rough prototype of things to come, with basic missions, barebones combat, and a simple map. However, this can be seen as an advantage, as it avoids pitfalls later GTA and Rockstar games have fallen into, such as gimmicky missions and too much plot. Those that want a pure sandbox experience will love it, but those that like their sandboxes with minigames, a deep plot, and will find themselves bored fairly quickly. As a fan of the basics without any nonsense, this game hit the spot.",1617680432,1617680432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

The hallmarks of the series, and this game in particular, are the somewhat comical and satirical alternative reality and the complete unfettered freedom of the open world.  Players are free to do missions or just navigate the city streets, filled with AI cars and NPCs running their own routines, making the entire simulation feel like it's living and breathing. 

The core gameplay consists of driving or third person shooting.  While GTA games are made for console and PC, the developers spend significant effort on the PC version stripping out the limitations of the consoles, making this a very rare exception to the fact that most console games cannot be recommended due to the shortcomings they bring to PC. 

The reason that the series has been so popular is the pure immersion. If you steal a car, the police will chase you.  You don't have to do missions if you don't want, you can just drive around, or steal cars and sell them, or rob people.  The missions and narratives are also extremely well done.  Another aspect of the immersion is that when you drive a car, you can listen to the radio, and there's a dozen radio stations with music, scripted radio shows, advertising, even talkback radio.   Rockstar spared no expense with the series and they paid close attention to every detail.

IF you have played san andreas or even vice city before then this will be a massive downgrade gameplaywise. If it is your first gta then its guite interesting to see how ambitious the game was for it´s time. I had a lot of fun with it but there are 2 gripes which almost ruined it for me. First of all there is no map. You have a minimap but it does not provide you with a lot of information. I never used the spray garage or the wapon store outside of missions where they were marked on the map because I just never found them again. The lack of a map is also a problem once you unlock a new area which is basically an island connected with one bridge. Before I knew the streets by heart it took me sometimes 10 minutes to find the correct street thtat leads to the bridge. This is especially frustrating if you have to restart a mission and it takes longer to find ypur way back than it takes to complete the mission. Actually it is pretty frustrating having to walk all the way back to the contract giver before you can restart a mission. Anyway my second big gripe is that at one point in the game a majority of missions will be timed. It might be challenging but it stops being fun after a while. Especially without a clear sense of direction it can be hard to fulfill your objective within the time given.

The game didn't age well but I'd recommend it because I played it as a kid. I remember one of my friends bringing it on DVD to class with whole 1,2,3 trillogy. As I had a weak notebook it was one of the most played games for me before I got Vice City. ""I'd recommend it"" but I can't, not after Rockstar took down fan projects that reverse engineered the game engine to fix the game for modern PCs. Rockstar never did anything to make the game more playable on modern PCs, community had to make fixes themselves. And after they tried to fix this for all the fans out there, they got kicked in the a*s by Rockstar. If You wanna buy it just remember that.
[h1] Story [/h1] 
As for the game itself the story is medium. I liked most of the missions but the fact that Claude works for just anyone and doesn't care for previous employeers: SPOILER [spoiler] You work for Kenji just to kill him later by order from your new employee that wants to start a war, Claude doesn't care for Asuka - Kenji's sister that helped him after he got betrayed. [/spoiler] This was one of the biggest things that made me think that he's unloyal to anyone after he got betrayed himself twice. Some missions get irritating when You have to do it all over again 3 or 4 times BUT there's only a few of them. You can collect hidden packages to make it easier for Yourself as after every death You'll have a set of weapons next to Your hideouts.
[h1] There are mods and fixes: [/h1] 
As for the things that made some people really pissed and maybe they based their negative reviews out of these things too.
Can't get a mission done because You're lost on the map with the small radar? Download a map and HD radar mods.
Getting annoyed by the fact You can't rotate the camera while driving a vehicle? Download vehicle camera movement mod.
[h1]Annoying missions[/h1]
There are multiple missions that have a timer and they're one of the most annoying missions in the whole game BUT I can't agree that 'Espresso-2-Go' is ""painstakingly difficult"" as the timer starts when You destroy the first coffee stand. You can roam around all 3 islands to get all of the stands marked on Your radar. If You'll still have problems with that You can always install a map mod which I previously mentioned. Another mission that someone mentioned to be annoying and hard is ""marked man"" where You must cross to another island to the airport with a timer. Once again I can't agree with ""It required you to go drive through a subway station at a random part of town."" Most of the bridges between an islands are located not far away from the island borders (horizontally and vertically). After all previous missions You should be somehow familiar with the way islands are designed. Once again even if You have to retry that missions 2 or 3 times it's not a big deal. After failing it once or twice You can either aimlessly try it again on an instant or get prepared for it after You know how it will look like. It's really easy to get prepared properly after 1-3 failed tries and it'll save You more time. If You want to have easier time navigating through the islands just install a mod.
[h1] Summary [/h1]
I recommend the game but I don't recommend paying Rockstar for it. They didn't release any fixes for modern PCs and kicked the modders community in the a*s.
Edit: you can not purchase classic gta trillogy and have to pay 60$ for remake. Seeing the trailers of the remake it's not even worth buying.

PROS:

- Great nostalgia trip

- Great game

- Great look back into gaming time, it was the first great open world game and first 3D GTA

- You can input cheats! NPCs fight! Cars explode! Gun cheats! Wanted Level cheats!

CONS:

- The game doesn't hold your hand through the missions. If you die, you have to go get your guns and armour back. Thankfully there are cheats you can input so that the game doesn't waste your time

- The Rockstar port is pretty bad. No bug fixes for the modern PC so it can be pretty annoying.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720574899
I HIGHLY recommend you look at a bundle of mods made by the community that enhances textures, adds things back in, and fixes things for the modern PC

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1962760372
I also recommend for those who want an experience similar to the PS2 to look at this guide. i suggest go through the guide section to find anything you like. But wait! Keep reading the review

- My game had times where it refused to open or would stay stuck open and I couldn't close it through Steam or task manager. Same point as above, it was ported poorly. This also goes for GTA Vice City as well! I've reviewed that too, in short for you the review is practically the same

SUMMARY (TL:DR)

- Good game
- Remember there's cheats
- Remember there's mods
- Remember you can rate the review helpful or award the review if it helped you!

Sure the 3D graphics look very dated by today's standards, the limited number of parts on the character's bodies looks so bad at times but the gameplay just makes this such a classic. One thing that does hit you is that in today's games you play off the two sticks, look on one stick and move on the other but GTA3 being nearly 20 years old use one stick for movement so you tend to run around in circles a lot to turn around, we just accepted it back then but now it feels quite uncomfortable to play like that, weird.

Comments:
1. If you have DirectX 9.0c installed, you should be able to run the game on Windows 10.
2. Save game file of GTA III original release will not work on the Steam version.
3. Sometimes, pausing the game may cause the mouse not responding. To solve this problem, just unpause the game (you may need a couple tries) and the mouse should work as usual.
4. Glitches encountered in this game
- The bulletproof Patriot SUV (which is acquired from one of the missions) disappears in the garage
- Completing D-Ice's missions and saving the game will cause his rivaling gang members to stop spawning, even if you start a new game. Hence, the coming new game will break. To avoid this glitch, I suggest skipping D-Ice's final mission OR play that mission anyway and skip saving.",1614932096,1614932096,True,1,0,0.50103306770324707,0,True,False,False,False,

Story: Story of GTA III is quest for revenge,it includes a lot of betraying and a lot of backstabbing.But apart from that it does not offer much.Characters to me are just walking stereotypes characters like Tony-Italian mafioso,Salvatore-clearly based on don Vito Corleone,and Kenji is just strict Japanese Yakuza member.Missions are entertaining and action packed,but it can also get very hard because of the game mechanics  
Gameplay-My biggest issue with GTA III gameplay was that it had no map so I always felt like I was lost and in some missions like infamous Espresso to go it can get extremely annoying.As with GTA Vice city I will divide this one into 32subcategories
                Driving-Well I guess it is as good as it can be in a game that is 20 years old.It can get clunky especially if you are driving faster cars,but you will get use to it eventually.Also major issue is that there is no motor bikes so that's a bad thing. Driving boats is even clunkier than in GTA Vice city
                Fighting-It is nearly the same as in GTA Vice city clunky,but it has a lot smaller variety of weapons available.  General setting-GTA III manages to capture dark atmosphere of the Liberty city's underworld,also it parodies a lot of bad stuff in American society.
In general,I would recommend this game,but I will warn you,arm yourself with patience because game can get really frustrating at times,it can be buggy,it can crash for no reason and some missions a really annoying.But all in all it is a good experience.

Having played through the whole thing in 2021 (my first time completing it, though not my first time playing it), I don't think it's aged well. By ""completing"" I mean doing all the main story missions, all the payphone missions, and collecting the hidden packages. Not bothering with the taxi stuff.

The AI vehicles often spawn in walls or crash into each other for no reason. I assume the developers were proud to figure out how to make the AI change lanes after four hours of caffeine coding, so they made all the AI vehicles change lanes every 5 seconds, not caring if that means they will crash into your car while you're driving at 120 miles per hour right past them (this is especially noticeable on the big bridges and in the tunnels). The game is not optimized for newer machines and assumes you are playing on a 1940s computer because cars will despawn when you look away from them if they're more than 5 meters away. If you play above 30Hz your car will not reverse in at least the first mission. And I had a problem with the menu options being too transparent when I started, don't remember how I fixed it though.

The story is okay but overrated. Ok, so Claude is a psychopath and will kill anyone as long as he gets money for it? Kinda lazy, I don't care for the guy at all. Much of the game, especially the third or so before the Mafia part, is just random ""go do this for me"" filler missions to make the game seem longer. And some of the missions are only available at certain times of day, so you just sit there on your phone until the in-game clock hits a certain time; fortunately, this only happens in Portland.

The game is very difficult to enjoy after you progress through most of the missions as random gang members all around the map will start shooting you. Yes, they even notice you if you're zooming past them in a vehicle, and your car blows up after taking a few bullets, in fact if you stub your toe against the car it will blow up. This makes many of the side missions needlessly difficult if you don't do them before the gang members turn hostile. It also makes most of the map unexplorable, especially the north half of Portland where you will just be insta-killed by angry Mafia members with shotguns. Speaking of the map, you don't actually get a map. You're supposed to ""get used to it and memorize the city"" as some bitter old man who I am paraphrasing said online when I looked up where I'm supposed to buy guns (it's not marked on the mini-map), yeah let me memorize the whole city with a squad of gang guys every 10 feet shooting at me. Prepare to use Google images a lot.

And the game just hasn't aged that well. You can't turn your camera while driving, I guess that's alright since there are buttons to reverse the camera and look at a fixed 90 degree left and right view but it takes a while to get used to. The guns are almost humorously inaccurate, you can aim a shotgun at someone from a few feet away and take four shots before you actually hit them once. And I am talking about alcohol shots because this game will make you a depressed alcoholic. At least one of the assault rifles rapid fires an accurate straight line of bullets, but they go slightly above and to the right of the cross-hair. If you die, you will lose all the guns you paid for, but that's okay because all you need to do is collect 100 hidden packages so the guns spawn at your safehouse, but don't worry, the game won't tell you which ones you've collected so if you use a guide and miss one you have to go through all of them again, just to complete some of the harder missions without contemplating premature real life expiration because of the lack of a sniper rifle. I should also add that, if you die at any point in a mission, you have to restart the mission from scratch, and I mean from the hospital walking all the way back to the mission giver. Great stuff!

The only good things I will give this game are the selection of music and the world design. But the world design doesn't even matter because you can't explore it without constantly being shot by the Colombian cartel.

So, I'm going to not recommend it, unless you fall into one of the following three groups: (1) old-school GTA fans who want to play the mediocre game they remember only through their flawed nostalgia glasses, (2) completionists like me who just want to play through every GTA game when they could be doing something more productive instead, (3) GTA VI developers who are required by Rockstar to play this so they know how to not make a GTA game. Note that fitting into one these groups does not mean you will actually enjoy the game.

Anyway I hope Vice City is better.",1613908787,1613908787,False,12,1,0.6073341965675354,0,True,False,False,False,

Killing people, blowing stuff up, driving here and here, car racing, that kinda sh!t.

For nostalgic reason, this game is fun, but g0ddamn the amount of work of getting this game to bloody work required about an hour just to make sure, you don't crash or f@#ked up here and compatibility stuff. Naturally, it makes you a modder working on that stuff up.

If you plan on purchasing this game, I recommend to BOUGHT THIS WITH THE TRILOGY BUNDLE and download the patch above I put. However, if you don't like to work on doing this stuff, you can get it by purchasing it via Rockstar Game Launcher (like you give a sh!t about it), or play it on f@#k!ng console. But yeah, Rockstar Game Launcher still has a Widescreen Issues, so, the patch above is STILL REQUIRED.

However, since I did have a few good memories when playing this game, I'll leave a thumbs up. 

Anyways, GTA III is the first 3d installment in the GTA franchise, so it was really impressive seeing rockstar being able to have a 3d open world experience where exiting and entering cars were a thing. Obviously the game has aged pretty poorly. The shooting mechanics are awful, the driving could be way better (you can't turn your camera when driving), the story was decent, and the movement is kinda awkward(your character will always turn in the direction of the mouse). However, I think the main selling point back then was the fact that this game had ALL of these things, and even today I think it's pretty cool, as the game offers a nice simulation of reality as a sandbox. You are able to commit crimes and have cool chases with the police although the drive-by controls only allow you to shoot left or right. The thing I didn't like about GTA 3 is how some missions felt tedious as some were just violent chores for the mafia or whatnot. I guess the main reason to buy GTA  3 would be to experience the decent story or have a simplistic GTA environment where cops are a bit more tough.

The bottom line: I would recommend GTA 3 on a sale or buying it with the GTA trilogy pack.",1612744704,1612744704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Although all the good things, the game is quite boring. The missions are not so creative, it's like every mission it's the same with a little variable that turns into a plothole. Sometimes you help the mafia by killing a bunch of his enemys, other time you are working for Yakusa and killing their enemies. When you do it for the first time, it's awesome, but when you start to advance in the game, it feels so repetitive, but it's understandable.
Some other aspects that I think adds to this sense of boredom: The musics in the radio are so forgettable. It's seems like just some generic songs in some genres. The Jah radio has like, three songs? It all sound the same, and it works for every genre (minus the main theme, the main theme is AWESOME!)
In conclusion, the game it's fun, a milestone in the history of gaming but, in my opinion, didn't passed the test of time.

I played this as a kid and I thought I'd pick this up when it comes on sale to relive some of those ""good"" memories I've had of it. As soon as I launched the game I knew it was going to be a shit show and here's how I got to that conclusion.

What went wrong:
- the menu's text is at very low opacity and I had to pop the steam overlay on and off just so the text would fade in a little bit to make out what I had to do, a problem that I have no clue on how to fix to this day;
- playing this when you have a multi monitor setup is awful as the cursor isn't locked on the monitor where the game is currently being played on (despite running the game in fullscreen);
- running the game at more than it's native 30 fps is going to give you all sorts of glitches (within the first minute I noticed my first glitch where I couldn't reverse the car if I had more than the locked 30 fps);
- the game itself is a terrible port of the console versions and I noticed it as soon as I aimed down the sights of weapons and the crosshair would just move around if I pressed the move controls (WASD);
- cars are made out of paper plates where if you crash it ever so slightly it already starts to smoke and it takes no more than 3-4 crashes to make it burn and eventually explode; 
- the suspension of some cars make it near impossible to take a turn without flipping them in the process;
- dumb AI that has no idea what to do in some scenario (like shooting at an enemy ahead of them if you're slightly out of range);
- trash AI pathing where the drivers would often miss an opening and would just grind against the wall trying to reach the destination despite it obviously not working;
- overpowered weapons that take less than half a second to kill you (I'm looking at you M4);
- missions that make no sense from the point of view of progression, at least in the beginning (feels like it's a game revolved around random missions instead of following somewhat of a story);
- really stupid enemy faction system where you often can't complete certain quests because they involve you passing through said territories and at any point an idiot with a combat shotgun can insta-destroy your vehicle;
- awful main character who would betray his own mother for a penny;
- mission timers that often are barely enough to complete them without re-trying;
- inability to check the map and this is really stupid considering some of the missions take place on a different island than where you took it from so you keep driving towards the mission until you realize you're near the ocean and it's on another freakin' island so you have to change your route 'cus the connection between them is on the side of the island.

The list would be endless if I had to write everything down, but these are the main problems that I couldn't get over. If you're looking to relive those childhood memories by replaying this game, don't. Let them be memories of what you thought at the time was a great game. I can not recommend this game despite trying time and time again to give it another chance at redemption, but the further I progress, the more I'm disappointed.",1611490076,1611593876,False,4,0,0.5046120285987854,11,True,False,False,False,

But unlike the other gta games, the gameplay and game code/logic definitely hasn't aged well. It's hard to describe it, but compared to other gtas the game mechanics feel much more simplistic (but not in a good way), peds aren't as good as the other games, vehicle damage from bullets is hard to tell etc. Ofc, it is the oldest 3d universe gta game, and it was very revolutionary at the time for what it had, and even 20 yrs later this game had more substance than alot of new triple A shit.",1611466912,1611466990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

The menu is somewhat broken with the text not being displayed at all, after a few seconds it will show up, but the text is transparent and hard to see for some reason.  This is only in the beginning at start when trying to load a game, etc. In game the text normal. 

2nd, Controllers for PC are atrocious and not fully able to be customized. In addition things don't work like aiming, driving and shooting (hit or miss? though it shouldn't even be a hit or miss situation to begin with). You definitely will need a pad for this to have a good time.

3rd, and it's the biggest one for me, if you have dual monitors, the game doesn't lock the mouse in game and as soon as you click the game will minimize. Having to worry about this and happen to you through out the game makes it completely unplayable for me.  

To avoid the major issues like keyboard and snapping your screen closed, if you have a game pad it solves all those problems.

(update: Even with a game pad the game doesn't work right).

It plays just like remembered,  feels a lot better than the ps2 port, and is a lot of fun. It fulfills nostalgia, and IS fun.

Now that I'm 20 I came back to play all of the old GTA games for nostalgia and am having an absolute blast.

Being one of the older GTA games there are some very noticeable differences right off the bat, features that are missing in the newer GTA games:

- First of all, there's no full map screen you can pull up, or GPS to help you get to your destination. Just a dot on the bottom left of the minimap that you have to drive to, meaning you have to drive around and get familiar with the city to know where you're going. There's lots of useful things spread out around strategic points on the map you can use to help you out, like health kits, losing wanted stars when being chased by police, the locations of gun stores, secret minigames or other powerups that reward you for exploring and knowing where everything is by experience.

- Second, there's no cover system, you cant crouch or hide behind low walls meaning the combat is very run and gun and can be pretty difficult at times.

- Third, if you die at all you lose ALL of your guns and start again with nothing but your fists but you get a ton of money from the story missions meaning you can very easily pick up more gear by buying it, killing NPCs with weapons or finding weapon spawned around the map. It's very important to save between missions so you can reload your gear if you die.

- That brings me to the missions. The missions are very short and sweet, most of them take around 5 minutes or less and are pretty simple (the game is from 2001 after all games were more simple then), but they are action packed and fun, and each mission manages to be different than the last. They can also be very difficult at times, I couldn't complete them as a kid but coming back as an adult I can usually clear them after failing the first few times and getting the hang of it.

- There are lots of things you can do besides the main story: fight in gang wars, get in shootouts with the police, work as a vigilante police officer, paramedic, taxi driver or fire fighter to earn money, participate in street races, find various minigames with lots of replay value and other secrets around the map, or just drive around and go on a crime spree, it is GTA after all.

GTA 3 was the very first 3D Grand Theft Auto game. This game is an absolute classic and though it lacks the features of newer games and even games that came only a few years after it like San Andreas, GTA 3 still possesses that beloved Grand Theft Auto feeling to it and at the time completely revolutionized what an open-world game was and changed videogames FOREVER, a true piece of gaming history and a must play if you are a Grand Theft Auto fan.",1609275896,1609276651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

не для широкой публики. Если у вас нет ностальгии, лучше поиграть во что-то ещё. Всё-таки 2020+ год на дворе. 

плюсы :
 - приятная езда на машинах
 - не картонное поведение окружения, часто происходит какой-то контент, без твоего участия.
 - атмосферная, запоминающаяся музыка
 - ощутимая сложность. 
 - неуспевающие надоесть, разнообразные, для ограниченного функционала миссии

минусы: 
 - главный герой - амеба. Не вызывает сопереживания. Делает всё, что попросят. 
 - безликие персонажи
 - персонаж не умеет плавать, нет полетов
 - нельзя двигать камерой во время езды / нельзя посмотреть полную карту ( без патчей по крайней мере )

The control scheme and camera is far more efficient and less frustrating than the original PS2 release and the allowance of mods like your custom radio station makes it a superior way of exploring the original Liberty City. While it is arguably the most visually aged 3D GTA title, it has a strange charm that seems all but unique to its series and  acts as a fun time capsule to life and culture in America 2001 through the satirical lens of British developer Rockstar.

That it can still illicit an unique feel despite being practically the starting point of the open-world sandbox is a testament to how ingenious GTA III was and is. It may not have all the refinements of later GTAs or other sandboxs down the road, but it can still impress when you consider all it does and allows you for a game nearly 20 years old.

I had immediately bought the disc and played the game. It reminded me of GTA2: the mute main character, style, driving, radios. At the same time everything was on the new scale: 3D, music, hits, the solid story line. I was disappointed that no story was continued from the second game, I couldn't see Zaibatsu again (except a commercial). However, overall impression was positive.

After many, MANY years, more then 19, I played again with the graphics upgrade pack.

Well. Let's compare the reviews.

Me, teenager.

Pros.:
- Awesome music. Especially RISE FM.
- Sniper rifle. LOVE IT!
- Driving, can steal any car, drive sport cards, some of them remind of GTA2 (Yakuza stinger).
- The story is so cool!
- Very sad to finish the game. I tried to finish all the missions but... Whatever. I finished.
- I just like to drive around the city!

Cons.:
- Some missions are hard, had to replay over and over again. That goddamn truck and Colombian mafia trying to destroy it.
- Goddamn airplane mission when you need to find the boat. I almost destroyed my keyboard.
- That's it I think.

Me. 2020.

Pros.:
- Music, Rise FM.
- Versatility of finishing some missions.
- Different ways of reaching parts of the city (tunnel or bridges).
- More weapons, more missions, more characters. Characters are memorable. Even though some of them are not really recognizable from the concept arts.
- The opening and ending theme. Attaching and fulfilling.
- The attempt to add some cinematography into the game. It's not a complete attraction like GTA2, full of shits and giggles. It's more serious. Even though some missions are fun, posters (Bad Fellas, for example). All these references to pop culture and movies (the Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, etc.).
- The system of hidden packages. The more you get, the better default equipment you have near the hideout. PRICELESS! You should plan the game play. AGAIN.

Cons.:
- Overbuffed Italian mafia with their shotguns. But it may be a cons, because you have to PLAN how to play. For example, finish side missions first.
- I miss that system of gang reputation from the second game. If you kill other gang members, you may restore the reputation.
- I REALLY MISS ZAIBATSU NOW.
- The music tracks is very VERY limited. I ended up listening to nothing, because I have heard it all.
- The graphics look awful. The game is dull. Physics are OK, but the details. The game required more details I suppose.
- The story is quite short. And characters are not that attaching. It was fixed in Vice City I guess.
- No bikes.
- No fucken swimming. It's ridiculous.
- There should be payment for the hideout. Like in GTA2. Of course, the shittier, the cheaper.

Anyways. THE GAME IS A LEGEND! I will show it to my kids. Or nieces and nephews.",1604320373,1604320398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

It was something unimaginable. It was not just something revolutionary in genre. Without any exaggerations it will be fair enough to say that this game was industry-changing phenomenon. There was nothing like this before. Not even close. Only Mafia, which was released later that year, came close enough to be called a worthy competitor. Unfortunately Mafia didn't get as much attention and had another priorities in general. In Mafia most attention was payed to the story, atmosphere of gangster movie and realism, while in GTA3 open word itself was the key feature.

I'm going to describe that time period in details, so if you want to hear the rest - make sure you've got a big cup of tea. The story will be long, and it even has a plot twist. Man, how many lessons were skipped, how many exams were failed, how many once happy and serene families were ruined by this game... Poor parents were searching all local computer clubs, in desperate attempts to find their brainless brats, who abandoned study and wasted last money to spend there days and nights without sleep. People really lost their mind about this game. Back then it even overshadowed CS 1.3 (wink). It was a common thing to enter a computer club and to see a bunch of totally immobile kids (like if they were glued to their seats) who totally lost count of time playing GTA3 and staring into the monitors with absolutely blank eyes. Sweet memories...

And just to let you know, computer clubs of the past had nothing in common with modern clean and quiet Internet or WI-FI cafes. Inside, many of them were rather dirty and had rather dense stench of cheap alcohol, bad tobacco and unwashed bodies. Entering some of them was like entering some cyberpunk reality, because those places were rather, lets say, spicy. They attracted ""elite"" from the very bottom of society who were openly trading with, hmm, all sorts of unconventional stuff. Thus, parents could rest assured that their kids are in reliable hands, hehe.

You are still on board? - Very well. Because here comes another touching passage about my acquaintance with GTA franchise, before I'll head for the conclusions about GTA3... Cold autumn of 1997. A friend of mine brought me a bunch of his discs with video games. One and a half dozen or so. Why? Da hell I know. I tried to remember but nothing substantive comes to my mind. So, what are those games? - garbage (it may partially explain my friend's generosity as well). It didn't take much time for me to put them into this cathegory. 

In this pile of trash, one game specifically grabbed my attention. Why? Because among all this garbage, this one looked even worse than garbage: broken box inside and outside, broken plastic, frontal screen was torn and dirty as if he wiped something with it... [i] what if he indeed did?!! [/i]... and depicted some low-res drunkman with a crowbar in some archaic glasses. Oh, by the way, the disc itself was full of scratches as well. So I tried to read some illegible description... dma design (nothing ringed the bell - probably developers?)... steal cars, shoot stuff, bla-bla... oh! the game's name - Grandfather Auto?... what the hell, sounds stupid - let me check it. Launched the game - ah, so that's Grand Theft Auto!

It turned out that the game was a blast. I spent maybe a week before I bothered to check the first mission, coz all this time I was just driving and shooting stuff while listening cool music. Stupid or not, but I had a lot of fun playing like that. Later on I started to fulfill actual missions, discovered paint workshops, secrets, hidden missions - great and unique experience for those times. 

Year after year, 2002nd has arrived. And GTA3 was released. And something unimaginable happend. Total disaster. The end of the world was at hand - my PC could not run GTA3... Are you crying with me? Incurable wound was inflicted and despair was absolute. Thus, I found salvation in the arms of Mafia. Mafia... worked on my PC.

Outcome is close, so check your belts... A year later I got top PC. The time has come to get what I was denied before. And GTA3 was №1 on my revenge list. So I played it. And I had some fun. But... nothing mindblowing. Incurable, as it seemed before, wound was healed and such a prominent game in gaming industry almost left me indifferent. I didn't even finish the game. ""WOW effect"" didn't happen. Now you understand why I was so sarcastic about those kids and their parents? Coz I wasn't a participant in all that GTA3 madness - I was merely a spectator. And such anticlimatic is the end of my story. 

Epilogue. Almost 2 decades later I decided to come back to GTA3. And this time I finally finished it and even got 100%. It seems like this time I even got more fun than years ago. Definitely great product of it's time. If you never played it, but at least played San Andreas (they share many similar mechanics) - you may check it. But if you started you acquaintance with francise from GTA4 - I have serious doubts that it will impress you anyhow.

Should i recommend it ? I obviously have no idea because rockstar aint fixin their broke ass game.

I had to download several files in order to fix the game and make it work properly, for some reason rockstar took down several HD texture packs, or the owners deleted it.

I tried to download the multiplayer, however there is no servers available.. even tho several people said that they still play this game.

I got a texture pack, i downloaded it and then my save file got messed up, i wasted 15 hours of my life just for this game, i wont be able to get those hours again, so do NOT download any mods, you wont be able to fix your file no matter what you do, i tried everything that i can.

Overall, this game was really hated for some reason which i'm not gonna be stating here because i'm not entirely sure why people hated this game at the time.

The game is alright, all you need to do is download a few files because for like the physics, the menu being broken, etc.

Resolution is broken, i had to download another file for that.

The characters sometimes look dead, the cars are fast as hell now.

I wont be downloading this game again because of the fact that it gets broken easily just with a mod, smh.

I recommend also getting the enhanced edition mods if you want to make this game feel newer, however it's not necessary.

This game is a blast to play and it does have it's awesome moments, though I wouldn't recommend this if you are easily tilted. Game is hard and likes to be unfair, but if you get over all that you'll have a really nice game in your hands.

It does have it's own share of fun glitches you can try and the soundtrack is pretty damn good.
Also did I mention this is also the only GTA game you can shoot people's limbs off in? Yeah, has it's own features still not present in the newer games.

Story missions are plenty but can get really frustrating, the ending mission being the hardest.

Rockstar added this ""Frame Limiter"" option which allows you to get 60+ frames, but this doesn't work properly. All it does is speed up the game and there are other bugs that come with it like i was sprinting and my character leaped forward 30 metres ahead. So its best to play it with Frame Limiter ON if you don't want that happening to you. Your game might not even run properly if you have Frame Limiter set to OFF.
Rockstar needs to remake these old games because technology has changed, they never did that. And also because fans have connected so much with the Rockstar characters that they want to see them again in future games. They're supposed to put out remakes or sequels by now, but eh, I guess they don't care about the fans.

Plus this is a bad game lol. I mean it sucks. THE CONTROLS SUCK. It's a bad game, but I have memories of it (nostalgia) so I enjoy re-playing it. But if it's your first time playing it, I doubt you'll have much fun. Do you really think a game from 2001 will beat a game from the current era? It may have been a good game to buy when it came out and you may have a high opinion of it cuz this was one of the best game in those days, but now better games have come out.

Too bad Rockstar doesn't seem interested in preserving classic games and with all their Sharkcard money can't be bothered to patch this one, so for the best experience this requires 3rd party fixes and mods. Not unplayable but for me that earns games an instant No in terms of Steam recommendations for games still being sold.

If the vanilla game starts on a modern Windows OS without issues, the main menu will probably break anyway, so you'll need to try to workaround with switching to the Steam overlay and back to make the text visible to even get into the settings and change the resolution.

High resolutions like 3840x2160 work surprisingly well, the HUD scales relatively well. But even though there's a widescreen option you'll need a 3rd party fix to avoid the image getting vertically squished. Make also sure you have Trails disabled - to avoid motion sickness - and Frame Limiter enabled to avoid physics/controls breaking (such as walking on inclines or cars being unable coast or reverse anymore).

Other vanilla restrictions include severe pop-in of pedestrians and cars and missing/broken lighting/reflections.

I used to play this game as a teen & loved it then! I decided to buy it again on Steam. It's an excellent game & essentially put open world games on the map. It has a great story, parodying popular Mafia movies with a great sense of humour, the kind that would be so familiar to other games of the franchise, along with an amazing sound track of the early 1990's & early 2000's. It's full of action, & hours of addicting gameplay that would keep you in Liberty City for a good long time.

Some criticisms are that it was made in a time when people were still figuring out how to produce a good 3D game, so the controls are a little tough to handle. It's hard to jump over obstacles, driving is a little stiffer than the later GTA games as well. You do eventually get used to all of the controls, but it's tough if you're used to the later games, then try GTA III. The subject matter is obviously controversial too, the game is named after a Felony, but if you like R rated Action movies & Mafia movies, you'll know what you're getting yourself into.

Grand Theft Auto III is the perfect example of a groundbreaking title that still is just as enjoyable. Arguably the most controversial game of 2001 and the first massive success in the video game industry of a post 9/11 world, GTA III is a game about revenge, murder and chaos. Set in the fictional New York-inspired Liberty City, you take control of a mute named Claude. He and his girlfriend Catalina are escaping from a bank heist when she turns on Claude, shooting him and leaving him on the ground for the police to find minutes later. A few days later while on a transfer to the city's detention centre a car intervenes with the convoy and frees the prisoners while also managing to destroy the bridge the event took place on.

The game contains a great open world that was extremely impressive back in the year of release. It has a good story but admittedly it's not very in-depth. The soundtrack is full of fantastic songs from the main theme's relaxing piano to the various radio stations filled with a selection of liscensed and original tracks. The graphics are still pretty decent by today's standards but the character models have not aged that well. There is oodles of activities and situations to get yourself into in Liberty City.

The year 2001 was one of the pinnacles of video game history, celebrating many awesome games from my favorite series growing up such as Sonic Adventure 2, Super Smash Bros.

Despite not taking off at its first sights during E3, it skyrocketed commercially, and that's what truly matters!

Taking on the role of Claude; a silent hitman who is portrayed as a clueless killer that's meant to be played with through your own personal perception of whether he was a psychopathic killer, or an anti-hero who deserved the vengeance he was seeking post-betrayal, and this makes everything even better. Rockstar is a game development team that was not afraid of taking risks, so they evolved the series into the third dimension; which would become the game a majority of gamers love today, with an awesome community dedicated to the series that always discover new things about the games as well as creating mods for them. Top-down games are certainly classics that I do not neglect as a fan of retro games, however, the series needed a tone that's more than what would be a game that you'd play at your local arcade. It became a cinematic interactive game that you direct on your own as the player, and that's what made the series unique.

I played all the other games in the series after this game and I enjoyed all of them. When I initially wrote my previous review, which I will leave attached at the bottom, I was p***ed about this game's content and design. I swore to myself that I wouldn't play this game again.
A year goes by and I decided to play the game again. 
Big. Mistake.
I delusionally thought that my issues about the game would be fixed by taking the time to get all the pickups and it would make the game easier.
It didn't.
I thought it would be a cool idea to get 100% in this game.
It wasn't. My blood pressure achieved new heights that would kill an elephant. 
I spent so much time playing this forsaken game that I actually think I hate it more than I did before. How in the h*** did 75% of this game get approved by Rockstar's quality division? I can't name a single instance where this game had an appropriate difficulty, even the first missions were difficult beyond compare. The missions are not capable of being done using anything, not even a f***ing controller or keyboard. The cars in this game somehow are worse than the other 3D games and even harder to control than GTA IV -- which was purposefully made difficult to control. The more I played this game the more I realized that this story sucks, there is absolutely nothing to this game other than useless drivel. 
I think I would have more fun passing a kidney stone than I ever did with this game.
Heed my warning: This game is s***. If I could rate this worse, I would do it in a heartbeat. Don't play this game.

Old review:
I got this game when I purchased Vice City and San Andreas because it was cheaper to buy the package deal than just the two other games. Since this was the first 3D era game I was not expecting the game to be like the Grand Theft Auto V. I have several problems with this game. The first is the keyboard controls are janky that one would require the growth of at least three more fingers and another hand in order to play this game properly. With this problem, I turned to my trusty Xbox 1 controller, and this is where problem two came. In order to play with my controller I NEEDED TO DOWNLOAD A MOD FOR IT. The controller setup was left at whatever it was for when the game was first released in 2002 or whenever it was. My third problem is the story is garbage. The story was not compelling whatsoever and whatever poor Claude did people seemed to get pissed off at him, despite the mute bastard doing exactly what they asked. My fourth problem is Claude DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM. He is so afraid of water that if he just touches it with his leg he dies, and that complicates things when you need to use boats for missions. That brings me to my next problem: some of the missions are so difficult that I barely finished them before suffering from a stroke because my blood pressure was so high. Speaking of rage and frustration, the cars in this game have the equivalent control of a TOY CAR. I would be driving the Securicar, one of the heaviest and most difficult cars to tip and the police are able to touch me and send that thing flying further than one can throw a baseball. 
The game design is so impeccable that I cannot find a modicum of bad things that this game has wrong. NOT. I wasted sixteen hours playing this dumpster fire of a game and meanwhile suffering from early 2000's game design. Take my advice and don't buy this game, even if it comes in that bundle with Vice City and San Andreas.",1596220945,1626989879,False,0,1,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False,False,

For an ""open-world"" game, it is shockingly linear in how it lets you tackle missions. Planting bombs in cars is a totally useless feature, since for missions where you need to assassinate someone, their car just so happens to be locked. Doing certain tasks out of order will just fail the mission outright, even though the cutscene itself explains what the overall mission goal is (ex: you need to lead someone into an ambush so the yakuza can kill them, but if you kill them yourself outside of that ambush, the mission fails). Also, the general lack of QoL features will really turn people off. There's no full map, despite having the entire city minimapped, which makes certain objectives that take place across the entire city frustrating to drive through. And not only are there no mission checkpoints. not only do they not allow you to restart the mission from the start when you fail, but they don't even allow you to load a save from the game menu, meaning if you want to restart a mission without losing all the money and weapons you lost from dying, then you have to exit the game completely, relaunch it from Steam, and THEN you can play the mission again. 

Why are so many GTA games like this? Why do they have good gameplay outside of missions, but when it comes to the actual story of the game, the ""open"" part of ""open-world"" is entirely forgotten? I know it's a bit of a buzzword, but this is just dishonest game design. It's a lie of freedom and ""do what you want"" attitude, perpetuated largely by the fans, which tricks newcomers into thinking they'll be allowed to form strategies for missions and be creative, only for the game to pull them back by the leash, and force them to have fun THEIR way (a.k.a. the worst way).

(I bought & played this game when it was released in 2001).  Believe all the positive hype – this game was revolutionary & a game changer when it was released 19 years ago.  This game set the standard for all future GTA games.  This game needs to be remastered for modern PC & gaming systems.    

This game introduced me to open world sandbox games.  Being able to play the main story at your own time & pace, and explore the map & complete side missions as a way to “take a break” from the main story was something new and very appreciated.  

This was the first GTA game to be made with a 3D-engine, a novelty at the time.  Even though the map is very small, back then, the world felt large and endless.  The map design is excellent, the way NPCs act is excellent, the soundtracks are excellent (including Lazlow!), and the gameplay is excellent.  There is so much good, you can overlook/ignore the criticisms (no swimming, no motorcycles, not being able to go inside the stadium, and no planes, except for the Dodo but flying it is a chore).  I spent a lot of time just driving around the map, enjoying the scenery, and exploring every possible place my character could access.

I played the entire game the first few times using no cheats and I’m glad I did.  It made me appreciate the game progression even more.  I used cheats later and had some hilarious times (ex: flying cars).  
Yes, later GTA games increased their map sizes, added new features, abilities, and characters, but there’s always something about GTA III that makes me come back again and again.  If you don’t have this game in your Steam Library, you haven’t lived.

You can drive around recklessly and shoot guns at people and do short missions that are all remixings of the same five mechanics for cash, and these mechanics all function decently well. It is, however, pretty goddamn primitive, bare-bones, and frustrating in several ways, as befits such a genre pioneer. The stuff I described above is just about all you can do, the game world is pretty small and empty, and your map is shit-awful at telling you where you are or how to get to where you're going. More importantly, the missions are terrible; right from the start, but even more so as the game progresses, they're overlong and finicky, often featuring timers with barely any leeway or combat situations that are nigh-impossible if you just charge in like normal. You basically have to trial-and-error every single objective in the last third of the game, which gets extremely aggravating extremely quickly. The last mission is so obnoxiously designed that, after an hour of trying, I just gave up and used cheats to get through it. GTA 3 is so comically outclassed in terms of depth, quality, variety, enjoyability, and amount of content that there's no real reason to go back to it at all unless you're interested in game history.

As much as I've enjoyed the GTA series, GTA3 never really struck that much of a chord with me. My favorite entries would have to be Vice City and San Andreas.

Grand Theft Auto III is a worthy title, don't get me wrong, and made the transition from top-down to full 3D TPS effortlessly.
But in terms of the graphics presentation, it has not aged well. Its visuals I think are the main reasons why I don't like it as much as the others. Everything just looks so dull. I understand it's supposed to be a gritty game, but everything really is just so dull looking and quite lifeless.

The controls are surprisingly acceptable for keyboard and mouse, although the fixed camera when driving was a bit annoying.
Also, I found the lack of a global map and permanent “locations hints” for Ammu-Nation and Pay 'n' Spray on the mini-map to be particularly annoying.

In the sound department, GTA 3 is only satisfactory, the sound effects of vehicles and weapons are acceptable, and the soundtrack is what you would expect, but the voice-overs, despite above average, are on a lower quality format, which makes understanding people really difficult sometimes.

In conclusion, GTA 3 might have been innovative for its time, but as it stands today, I cannot recommend it, since the sequels have done it bigger and better than what is presented here. GTA 3 is not a bad game per se, it’s just not a “unique enough” experience to justify its purchase anymore.
So unless you are a GTA fanatic, you’ll be better off playing its sequels.",1592019938,1592019938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

I’m about to praise this game to Heaven and back, and I wouldn’t blame you for chalking my kind words for GTA III all up to nostalgia, but I promise I haven’t even played the game until now.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++Grand Theft Auto III's difficulty is severely exaggerated. It's a challenging game, sure, especially in comparison to the brain-dead easy GTA V (I actually do like V believe it or not lol) and as such you'll have to actually give at least half the missions in the game more than one attempt to pass, but I really
don't understand why so many of these missions are infamously difficulty within the series. Some of the supposedly hardest I managed to do in one go, even missions with timers I made mistakes in (multiple wrong turns, crashes, etc.) and yet I still got passed them in one go. The only mods I used were the SIlent Patch
to get the game running on modern platforms, the widescreen support patch and the controller support patch (which doesn't even have auto-aim), so I doubt anything made it easier.
++Vehicle handling is really enjoyable. My biggest problem with GTA V was the vehicle handling and now I realise that’s why I never enjoyed that game that much but here it’s brilliant (even if you’ll constantly flip). It’s incredibly responsive, you’ll rarely spin-out and when you get one of the fast cars, the
sense of speed is great. It’s just joyfully arcadey, which is nice since driving is without exaggeration what you’ll be doing throughout at least 80% of the time.
++The city is one of my favourites in the series. It’s easy to get around and varied enough
++Missions are really varied and well-designed. They're often short but incredibly fun. This is a bit of a back-handed compliment, but given how really not great the gunplay is, which I'm sure Rockstar knew, most missions aren't built around firefights and as a result they really let their creativity shine in
creating diverse scenarios instead of focusing on a proven formula (had the shooting been well-designed).
++This game's got a decently strong atmosphere that I love. It's dark, satirical without turning its narrative into nothing but a joke, and a joy to be immersed in.

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Graphics have held up really damn good once you get HD resolutions set-up. It's smooth yet detailed and even has some nice fake reflections here and there that still hold-up fairly well.
+Car deformation still looks pretty damn good even today. It’s more impressive than V. Seriously.
+Story-mode progressions feels rewarding as you gain access to new parts of the map and along with it new stores with new weaponry and new vehicles
+Great length to it
+The game's story is straight-forward, but it's not boring or uninteresting. The characters are likeable and well voice actored and even the mute protagonist is one seriously awesome, cold-blooded, vengeful, mercenary motherfucker.
+Sound design's good. You can tell it's GTA III just by listening to it thanks to the weird, repetitive, random NPC muttering and odd musical riffs near certain mission providers that lend to the game's slightly off atmosphere.
+The hidden collectibles, you know, those usually useless hidden items scattered around the place in every open-world game since, are actually helpful to find, as once you hit 1/10th you're granted a new very useful item at your safehouse
+Gore is awesomely brutal. Every piece of the Human body can be dismembered and decapitated with any type of weapon. It's great watching a crowd of people get blown up and have 3/4ths of their limbs removed, or to watch someone briefly hold their stump of a neck as blood pours out of their hole like a fountain.
It's sadistic in the way only video games can harmlessly entertain, and it more than makes up for the lack of ragdoll physics that make kills in the HD universe GTA games so rewarding.
+Characters are well animated, especially in cutscenes, despite character models looking like they're made-up of a more geometrically advanced version of Lego

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]
+-The conversational bits in the radio stations are the best bit about this game. Not even kidding. They're legitimately laugh-out-loud funny and really well written and voice-acted. The issue? The repetition is insane. You will hear the same fucking interviews over and over and you'll hear the same awful songs over and over until your ears bleed. There's about 2 songs I actually like, as well as a few musical interludes and original soundtrack stuff. The rest depresses me thinking anyone actually gets paid to produce this crap. Thankfully you can turn it off...
-+Compatibility with modern platforms sucks ass, but that's to be expected from a game from 2001... there are fantastic fan-made patches out there that make the game run perfectly on modern computers and they're easy to install. Even getting native controller support, along with on-screen correct controller prompts
and stuff like vibration support is easy to get installed.
+-Vehicles flip incredibly easily but honestly it doesn't even bother me. You're given ample time to get out of the way of them exploding (as they do once they flip) and vehicles are absolutely everywhere so you're never lost without a car. It's just something you get used to. Drive around, flip, run before it blows
up, get a new vehicle, keep going. It's just the rhythm of the game lol.
-+The gunplay as I've mentioned is pretty fucking poor. I mean, the crosshair doesn't even line up to where your shots hit at close - medium distances, but it is serviceable and it never frustrated me. In its crappiness it actually opens up different gameplay scenarios which have you
utilising long-ranged weapons and explosives in order to take out your enemies before they can really get their shots off at you. It sucks, yes, but not in a way that detracts from the actual gameplay, because the gameplay is rarely centered on the gunplay and so when it is it's a minor tactical divergence
from the other driving based objectives.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-I really wish Pay ‘n’ Sprays and Ammunations were marked on the mini-map at all times. They’re often put in out of the way areas which can be difficult to memorise.
-Having to rebuy weapons and armour everytime you fail a mission, as well as to drive all the way back to said mission marker and then to drive to another place for the mission can get exactly as tedious as it sounds. It would've been nice to be able to just start immediately as soon as you die at mission start so you
don't waste your time, but it's not a big deal as mission markers aren't all that far away in the game world's medium size full of fast cars and smooth handling.
-There's a few extra little game modes, like side-quests from phone booths that sometimes have interaction orbs around them and sometimes don't, and sometimes lead to different missions or just replay the same ones everytime (which is annoying when you can't quit a mission without going out of your way to fail it or finish it)
and things like those set vehicles that actually force you into a whole different game mode where you're put under a timer make me wish the game told you what you're about to get into before you do. This game would've sucked for a completionist back in the day.

Coming back to [i]GTA III[/i] after all these years, the game’s many flaws are more predominant now. Driving physics are inconsistent and crashes often either end up in the vehicle coming to an instant halt, or flying through the air. Likewise, NPC behavior when driving is erratic with them changing lanes without any good reason and crashing constantly into the player. Shooting lacks any real impact and feels bland. And it also goes without saying that the game’s graphics are dated, with blocky and hideous character models. Mission structures are also very simple and revolve around the player driving somewhere or eliminating someone. Missions are enjoyable for the most part, but some are cheaply designed and completing them boils down to luck which can make the experience infuriating at times. Later levels involve driving long distances with the destination being unclear due to the lack of an in-game map. On the bright side, [i]GTA III[/i] is at its best during the driving missions and it’s obvious that it was designed first and foremost as a driving game. There is also a lot of side missions and unlike the newer games in the series, completing them was an enjoyable experience.

I had to patch the game for it to run properly on modern operating systems and to fix issues with widescreen and lighting. I did not experience any crashes or game-breaking bugs, but occasionally the sound effects would repeat themselves endlessly, and the mini-map landmark icons disappeared midway through the game. I also witnessed some hilarious clipping issues.

The weakest aspects of the game, however, are the story and characters which are not really explored much. Claude as a protagonist is also not relatable and his motives are not explained. By the end of the game, you can’t play the game for more than one minute without any of the rival gangs shooting at you which takes away the satisfaction of finishing the storyline. Also, there is noting to do with the money earned in missions, making the monetary reward of missions pointless. For all these reasons, [i]GTA III[/i] feels bland and lacks the charm of the future titles.

Overall, I found [i]GTA III[/i] immensely enjoyable half the time, and extremely infuriating the other half. The game mechanics are dated and not everyone will enjoy the overall product, especially after having played the newer titles in the series. As a result, I can only cautiously recommend [i]GTA III[/i], but for the price of admission, there is a lot of content on offer. [i]GTA: Vice City[/i] came out only a short while after this game and feels more balanced and polished in every aspect and is a much better choice overall.",1589269254,1589269438,True,6,0,0.558633148670196533,0,True,False,False,False,

Full Review:

The game definitely shows its age but by merit of being an open world game in a typical GTA setting its already worth playing. The game's main problems are just QoL stuff that get in the way of fun; for example in GTA V you have full control over your car and you can flip it upright if its completely turned over even when you realistically shouldn't be able to. In GTA III, if your car flips over its done for and will explode after some time. Its really annoying when you're on a time based mission and flip your car, making you have to go find another. 

And on the topic of missions, they're not too bad. The way the game works story wise is that you have major plot points (just changing who you can take missions from) every once in awhile with random missions padding out the time. There are a lot of different ideas so its not always boring, and even the more menial missions like driving cars from one place to another can help you learn the map and feel more at home with the world (at least to someone like me who's really bad at navigation). I've definitely been challenged, but the open nature of the game lets you solve things the way you want. For example there was one where I had to kill a guy who was a police informant. If I did any damage to his car I'd immediately get a 4 star wanted level. So I just bought some grenades, threw them in front of his car which one shot it, and cleared the mission much easier than my first couple tries. 

At the time of this review I haven't beaten the game; I've done about half the main story missions (which puts me on the second island with all of Asuka's missions done and partway through Kenji's). I'll give a little review on what's happened so far and to be honest its not great at. You start as a guy named Clyde who escapes from the cops after being backstabbed by one of his partners-in-crime. To earn a living you work as a grunt for the mafia who are trying to gain dominance over the part of the city you're on. Honestly this part of the story was pretty fun, you really feel like you're becoming someone important as you go on. But then shit happens, you move to another part of the city, and start from basically 0 as a grunt for the yakuza who are in that part of the city (which is based off of NYC). That ""twist"" was pretty annoying since like I said it was fun being part of the mafia, and when the reason you have to leave is random and pretty forced. 

The sense of progression is also pretty meh, if you just play though the game's story straight the only way you really progress is getting access to the other areas of the game. The game does have these collectibles called mystery packages and the more you get the better weapons spawn at your house (which is just where you have to save your game, more on that later). I guess Rockstar wanted to incentivize exploration but it felt weird that that was the way they decided to give you weapon upgrades. You also get a lot of money, but at least as far in as I am there's nothing to spend it on other than weapons which cost like 5k max when I was running around with 400k+ at that point. GTA San Andreas at least had big investments like the safe houses around the game. The story while not the worst thing ever just feels like something you do when you're bored of running around doing criminal acts (which could be the point but at the same time you need to do it to unlock more areas to run around in).

I definitely derailed from the point on the game's QoL issues so I'll go back to that. Like I said the whole car flipping issue is pretty annoying and it sucks when its a car you want to keep (although the second island at least has a bunch of fast sports cars if that's what you like). Mobility is just ass, San Andreas did it way better. For example if you run up to a wall in SA and press jump you'll climb it, while in III you hit it and Clyde will do this weird step back animation that's way too long. Jumping will almost never get you anywhere and while there's still so much to explore, its sadly not really something you'll be doing on foot a lot. 

Another thing is the saving system, you have to drive all the way back to where ever you're living at that point to save the game instead of doing it where you're at. Personally a lot of the time I was just relieved to finish the mission I was on so I didn't care but I can definitely see others being annoyed about it. Similarly (and this one actually annoys me) there's no kind of checkpoint system for missions. Fail a long one just before you finish it? Too bad, drive all the way back to the person you're getting the mission from and do it all over again. GTA IV definitely did better with that. Hell, they didn't need to make checkpoints after every part of the mission like IV did; if they just made it so that you go back to the mission's start I'd be way more fine with it.

Water is basically the void; Rockstar only added swimming in GTA SA. So if you accidentally drive off a bridge its over for you, your health instantly starts scrolling down (plus you have to wait for your car to nearly stop before you get out unlike later GTAs, so there's no room for error). There are boats to traverse it but they're needed for like 2 or 3 missions so far. Water's main purpose is to be the artificial roadblock sectioning off other parts of the city until you complete parts of the story. 

I saw this in another review and forgot to add it in, but there are helpful places around the game like weapon stores and places to get your car sprayed (which hides you from the police). In GTA SA these places are marked but in 3 they're not. Like I said there are missions that make you go to these places so you learn in that sense but even still they should've done it.

Overall its a fun game, and you can tell Rockstar realized what made their games fun from the beginning. Because of that I think its absolutely worth your money even with the more archaic mechanics. It would definitely help to be a patient person however.",1589007846,1602704493,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,

So I guess this is the only reason why GTA III has so many positive reviews.
I tried out GTA II a long time ago, completed GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas several times and GTA IV once, so I decided to give this game a chance. Well, now I'm not sure if I should have done it.

The main problem with GTA III is that the navigation in this game is simply horrible. There is no in-game map (only tiny radar in the corner of the screen) and design of the cities is really bad. I've spent incredible amount of time just trying to find my way to the objective.
Combine this with ridiculously timed missions and you'll get your GTA III recipe of rage and frustration.
It also has the same problem as GTA Vice City - inability to swim, but in GTA III you can't crouch as well.
Most of the missions are short, random and unreasonably hard.
Add some minor bugs (like disapprearance of unic car you parked in your garage) and dull storyline with dumb ending and here you have it.

Well, yeah this was the open world game responsible for all the open world games that we have now, and while some manage to be way better than gta 3, like Borderlands or San Andreas, there are still games coming out this year that claw at the feet  of a game from 2003, most prominent of these are Ubisoft games like Assassins Creed and Watchdogs series. This was the beginning if a genre that we still love to this day. And we have Rockstar to thank for it

So to be simple with the game, its story is pretty good, i always wanted to do campaign stuff instead of less around the map, mainly because the campaign let me explore it anyway. The start was great, the mid-story was all right and the ending was satisfying, people who finished the game know what i mean when i say i laughed near the start of the end credits. The open world was small enough to be recognisable and big enough to have depth. The characters were pretty ok and the missions were (mostly) fun. Some problems i see is that it hasnt aged well, its driving mechanics are kind of sensitive and the cars are fragile as hell. Alot of the missions were fun but were overshadowed by the worst god damn missions ever created.i will forever see the infamous coffee stand hunt in my nightmares and i couldnt finish the game quickly without using cheats. And thank god for cheats otherwise id still be trying to finish the thing. Even though it has its fair share of flaws, thats understandable as to why. Alot of older games were like this too.

Don't forget to turn off ""Frame Lock"" and ""Frame Limiter"" in Options afterwards.

To improve graphics even further, I suggest to turn on Antialiasing and AF in your graphic card's settings.

First off the game is a mess technically. Although steam did its fair share to port it, the game does not run what so ever right out of the box. You have to jump through a few hoops and unofficial patches to get it to run.

Secondly the game did not age well at all. The core gta mechanics are there but you're stuck with a mute protagonist, a somewhat dull game play, and a lot of quality of life improvements missing from the other gta. The game is frustrating to play, the moments of fun easily get taken out by the amount of pointless things you have to grind though just to get there.

If there is one word in my opinion that defines GTA III, this word is: Classic.

This is an almost 20 year old game, but somehow it doesn't show it's age through the graphics or the mechanics.

As the first 3D gta game, it somehow burdens the sequences, even the ones that are supposed to happen on the past, as San Andreas. They took some of the good things, but they also applied the bad ones too. 

Heck, the paramedic missions may have caused severe PTSD on some serious gamers all around... and they put the # level system in almost every single sequel too... 

The mod community also made some work for this title, making it feel more modern in some aspects. From HD textures to achievement system.

If you're a fan of the GTA franchise, give it a try, see where everything started, you won't regret it.

It's every bit as good now as it was back then, and still good compared to GTA games of today. There's a decent story with fun missions, some are pretty hard. Collecting hidden packages and doing side mission gives you so many powerups that you can end up tanking you way through hard missions if you need to. It's full of easter eggs, and the funny moments that makes GTA what it is.

I really recommend looking up the guide for the GTA III fixed version. It's a series of community made fixes and addons that have been packaged together.

Had to do some serious customization for the controller, but it works, kind of clunky tho.

So this game has some issue with the aiming where if you aim in the middle of the crosshair your bullets will travel up and to the right of what your aiming at.  I just saw that there is a fix online for that issue, but I did not try it.   
Also, if you experience a bit of lag as I did in the beginning of the game, try to check the audio driver in the settings of the game and select one of the other options.  It eliminated the lag entirely.

All in all, to have a chance to go back in time and play one of the games that changed the way we play certain games and introduce a more adult vibe in video games.  I still had a blast going back and reliving this game once more.  Adding the Custom soundtracks to the game to have my own music playing was nice.  The radio channels in GTA 3 bring quite a bit of humor to the table.

[b]pros[/b]
++ the radio station chatterbox is the favourite in any GTA game
+ influential and revolutionary game. all GTA games after GTA 3 vastly copied the formula and has been used by other games as well
+ gunplay
+ graphics
+ performance
+ blood and gore
+ decent ending

[b]cons[/b]
- presentation is rather weak with bare-bone characters and mission introduction
- the camera lags behind the car's turning, making incoming traffic hard to see
- terrible timed missions
- no map. sure, there is the mini-map, but you will never know how far away the objectives are

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
GTA 3 can still be recommended to play the game if some fixes are applied. However, if you have not played any old GTA yet, I'd probably recommend you to check out Vice City first since it comes with a much better presentation.

[b]Guide to fix the game[/b]
1. visit this page https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/
2. download and drop the content ""DDraw Component"" and ""SilentPatchIII"" into your GTA 3 data folder
3. visit https://steamcommunity.com/app/12100/discussions/0/1699415798780663072/ . choose one of this fixes and drop the file into your GTA  3 data folder. this allows for 60 FPS in the game
4. enforce 60 FPS of frames in the nvidia inspector. disable all frame limiters in-game in the settings
5. shoot at walls to see if your aim is off. putting widescreen to off might fix the aiming issues if you have any

It's one of my few ""comfort games"" where I've been playing it since I was 5, and I'll be playing it until I'm 50. I have such a fascination with the setting of Liberty City and how it's portrayed in this game, the pacing, the soundtrack, the story. It's all bundled together into such a tightly interwoven package that when you've finally finished it, it's impossible to leave feeling anything but satisfied. The blue and green, hazy, adrenaline-pumped Y2K symphony of chaos is unlike anything else ever made, and scratches an itch deep in my brain like nothing else quite can.

I have a bit of a crush on this game for a strange reason: It's one of the few games that game out very close to the turn of the millennium, when I was born. It gives me a sort of nostalgia for an era I just barely missed. Others include Deus Ex and to some degree, Metal Gear Solid 2. I've found myself to be very fascinated with American culture from about 1998-2002, and this fits just neatly in, released only a single month after the world-shaking events of 9/11, and only that long due to the fact that Rockstar's offices were quite close to ground zero.

Looking back on GTA 3 just over 18 years later, it's clear to me that this game will continue to stand amongst my most played and most loved for the rest of my life, and that it does and will continue to align with the rest of the GTA 3D trilogy as a master-crafted period piece. Vice City in the 80s, San Andreas in the 90s, and 3 in the 2000s. This game was a fantastic product of its time and environment which could not possibly be replicated today. We're not in the same world anymore. This is one of the last pre 9/11 pieces of entertainment ever made, and it is in my opinion, Rockstar's greatest ever accomplishment and should be played by anyone with a knack for open-world chaos.

It's an very important game for video game history.
Even tho GTA 3 is a good game there are many problems.

I would say that the biggest problems are the driving physics, the time limits on some of the missions are too short and of course the fact that your vehicle explode when it lands upside down.

Good things.
As I said this is a fun sandbox. There are a decent amount of thing to do and stuff to find and of course great cheats.

Ive always heard about how 3 is easily the worst due to the difficulty and clunk. Im not saying its a bad game, but wow this game drastically rises in difficulty almost to the point of it being unplayable once you reach the 3rd island. How there was never a patch to increase vehicle durability is beyond me, some sections dont seem to be play tested. EX: I almost quit 100 percenting this game when i did a rampage that required 20 people to be ran over. 20 gang members with guns that blow up your vehicle in 5 bullets. How are you supposed to complete that?? Well luckily for me i remembered i had a bulletproof vehicle that was gifted to me during an earlier mission making it a breeze. Problem is players can easily lose this vehicle or destroy it due to vehicle's poor durability. 

Another thing is how fragile these vehicles are and how wildly inconsistent the damage dealt is. There are times when i'll run head first into a wall full speed and be smoking white (low damage) yet sometimes i'll simply get pit maneuvered and bam my vehicles on fire...from a pit maneuver? Ok game.

It comes from a time where you health doesnt regenerate, and no autosaves. So playing this for a couple hours you get back into the older graphics.

Compared to other GTA game they're not only better than GTA3, they're MILES better. 

The combat is god awful, the mission design is is boring and sometimes questionable as very odd things can get you wasted (fail the mission), you can't swim (!?), no map other than the HUD. The protagonist himself, Claude, is just useless. I don't like silent protagonists in general, they just seem like an excuse to move the plot along comfortably. What's worse is the almost all other characters are very uninteresting. The only one remotely interesting is Catalina and that's because of San Andreas, not 3 itself. But GTA3 is undeniably charming. It has that uniqe GTA feel to it, you know? When you're driving around, blasting good music on the radio, causing havoc, that is fun. But the overwhelming feeling I had during gameplay was just I wanted to finish it. Not a good sign. But it's an interesting time piece, a blueprint for what came from its legacy.

Backdoor of a bank. Bank alarm is ringing. 

Catalina: Sorry babe. I'm an ambitious girl. And you (gun shot), you're just  small time.

Police convoy crossing the city and heading to the Callahan Bridge. 

News: Liberty city is in shock today, as the police and emergency services deal with the aftermath, of a devastating attack on a police convoy this morning. As yet, no details have been released about the prisoners being transferred in the convoy, and no proof has claimed responsibility. A convoy left police headquarters early this morning, for a routine transfer of felons, to the Liberty City penitentiary. The attack took place on the Callahan Bridge, leaving few witnesses, and the bridge itself, severely damaged. Some of the convicts are thought to have perished, in the explosion that followed the initial attack. Revelations as to the professionalism of the attack, struck police hours afterward, when identification of the missing felons were further hampered by an attack, by computer hackers on police headquarter databases. With the Porter tunnel-project falling behind schedule, this disaster leaves Portland isolated from the rest of the city.

Colombian cartel cars stop the convoy and retrieve a prisoner by threatening police. 

Colombian Cartel: Come on! Senior dickhead! It's no problem to kill you. You gonna be sorry. A'right, a'right. Get lost.

8-ball knocks out a cop. A bomb dropped off on the bridge explodes. 

8-ball: I know a place on the edge of the Red Light District where we can lay  low, but my hands are all messed up so you better drive, brother.

Extra:

Addictive, fun, GTA 3 is a great old classic game. The radio stations make every car ride a joy (and if you don’t like the game’s radios you can add your own music library), the story is well written and the open map offers great opportunities for high speed car chases or AK47 rampages. Despite being nearly 20 years old, this game still has it. Only downside is the single player only gameplay. Mafiosi, yakuza, drug dealers and prostitutes: they are going to be your new found friends...and possibly your future enemies. Get ready to get backstabbed and set off a lot of explosions.

There were other games in the series, but they very diffrent. They were in 2D, had a diffrent structure and played diffrently than the 3D games.

GTA III is a good game on it's own, but compared to its successors, it has some flaws.
The most important one is that the game has no full in-game map, only a minimap. Back in the day, the map came with the box, but if you buy it digitally, you don't get the map. This is a minor problem because one, you can look up a map on the internet and two, if you play all the missions you will eventually memorize the layout of the city . But it is a real pain in the *** for some missions where you have to go to a diffrent island and you don't know where you have to go to because you cannot look up your destination on a map.

Also a problem are the controls. Claude, the main character, cannot swim, nor can he duck or automatically aim. There is no cover system in this game unlike later GTA's so you will get hit whenever you see enemies, so kill them as quickly as possible. 
The music, although still good, is also not as good as other games in the series. There is much less music, and the music that is there is less good in my opion than that in other games. The talkshow was IMO the best radiostation of the game. 

There isn't really a big story compared to the other games in the series, and most of the cutscenes are someone telling Claude what to do and Claude nodding becuse he's a mute. Despite that, the missions are still worth playing because the game has some cool side characters and villains that will return later in the game, and most of the missions are really fun to play. They might be a bit challenging sometimes, but nothing to worry about since I've completed them and I'm generally terrible at games.

Overall, you might think I hate this game, but I don't. I really like this game despite all of its flaws and consider it a must buy for big GTA fans and fans of old classic games in general, not only to see where GTA became a cultural phenomenon, but also because it still a really good and fun game.

Everything felt dated, the initial animation seemed strangely blurry, the menus working badly until after starting the game, the graphics pretty old and the cars pretty awkward to control (and often rolling over) in comparison to what I'm used to. But I thought I should give it a chance and if I didn't like it, I'd just move on. After playing for a while and getting the hang of controlling it, it really grew on me. Discovering what the city had to offer and doing some first missions hooked me enough to stay. And then as I progressed, the missions got more interesting and I got access to better weaponry, I started having waaaaay too much fun with all the crazy random action going on and the intense, funny situations I was getting into. It's a bit difficult to pinpoint what exactly makes it so fun, but it feels like after every game session you get stories to talk about with your friends. This game really made me want to keep playing just because I was having too much fun. Did I care much for the missions? Well, they were decent and interesting to do, sure. Just to give you some goals. But it's not the game's strongest side, especially that Mafia came out around the same time and showed how storytelling in games should really be done.

Anyways, first things first, this came out in 2001, and that in and of itself deserves an applaud, (given the incredible graphics for the time, and still sharp visual effects and art direction) but literally revolutionised open world games. Almost 100% of the open world games you play today will have been influenced somehow by Grand Theft Auto III. It has loads to do, and a decent challenge level. This is my favourite Grand Theft Auto game, if not one of my favourite games of all time, (sure, part of that is nostalgia of Christmas, 2001). It has a great story of revenge, and manages to capture what rising up the ranks really feels like, great humour and voice acting, great writing, and not to mention they pulled this all off with i silent protagonist! driving feels great, and so does playing it.

Before this game came out, it was VERY rare for any game to have both driving and walking on foot in it. The only other previous example that comes to mind is Driver 2 on the Playstation 1.... and the on foot controls in that game were trash.

Every little thing you can do in this game was something you would previously have to buy a separate game to do. Want to play taxi missions on a home console? You're gonna need a Dreamcast for that. For third person shooters we have a few options on the PS1, like Syphon Filter. Open world driving game? That's what Driver is for. And open world racing? Rockstar just started putting those on console with Smuggler's Run and Midnight Club. How about a game where you can drive a cop car and ram into people? Need for Speed III, also a PS1 game.

There were also some other options if you had a decent enough PC at the time, but it was limited. Point being, when GTA III came out and put ALL of that into one game, and you could get it on a home console, it's understandable why people would lose their minds over it. It opened people's eyes further on the kinds of things that were possible to put into a video game.

But now it's 2019, and it hasn't aged that badly at all. You play a game like Driver, which came 2 years before it, and it's like night and day. Sure, being the PC version, there's a few hiccups you have to get around (the thumbsticks on my controller don't work properly with this game's settings), but if you can make it work, it's worth it.

Turned out I thought wrong. I was finally getting a proper gaming computer where I can play all the latest games no problem, and GTA V was one of them. You can say that it's already a pretty old game for 2019 but it wouldn't hurt to be updated with all major AAA games would it. As long as it's not an EA title, it's going to be alright. Because you know the same way I do, EA bad, hail Geraldo, upvotes to the left.

It would have been way too appropriate to start the binge-play from the very first release, GTA I and then GTA II, but Steam doesn't allow for buy those two games nowadays for some reason, I know, a shame. So the safest start was GTA III, probably the most underplayed game from my part in the franchise.

I remember the first time when I got to play this revolutionary game on a cybercafe way back in the day when I could only count in the three digits and be proud of it. Way too young to play a game that matures, but people from my generation all grew up the same.

Playing a game from the early '20s in 2019 seems a bit of a downgrade, talking graphically, vocally, functionally, but not gameplay-wise surprisingly, but there was still a lot to be picky about. I played the steam version lately, the same version that had some weird patch that broke some stuff off which was really annoying, I was okay with it, I didn't really notice anything at first until I started to watch a few gameplays of the game on Youtube and noticed how different everything was, talking about the color palette.
The game was extremely dark, and I thought GTA IV was a dark (atmospherically) game. Not every vehicle had their proper colors in display, everything was in a darkened shade of itself making it hard to see anything without having to raise the brightness a few levels or maybe to the max. And don't even get me started on the broken vehicle handling where as soon as you trying to drive backward, the vehicle down speeds a sick turtle as if it was pulling mountains worth of mass slowing you down and making it almost impossible to drive back without losing your nerves.
But the biggest annoyance or I was the inappropriate UI scaling, the aspect ratio looked like having a stroke, and the map's marker is so tiny that a needle couldn't possibly poke them.
Luckily, there was a community patch I installed which fixes all of these annoyances and made it a far greater experience to have, the UI scaled properly, the vehicles and the overall atmosphere got back their nature vibrant colors, and the vehicle handling got a lot better. But the problem lies in the fact that you have to look for problems and solve something that the game should have had solved from the get-go, given the fact that it's a paid game and from a pretty big-name game developer. Rockstar, please fix.

I did not want to alter the game too much or else I would miss on playing the vanilla game, but oh boy was the absence of a grand scale map annoying. Sadly enough, yes, there was no way to see the game's map, at least, not one that I know of.

Given the nit-picking, GTA III is a solid open-world that gives you all the opportunities a maniac would want to break havoc and start an all-out war with the state's authorities. It's always fun to blow up speeding FBI cars while driving an obese world war 1 looking tank, all guns maxed out and a sheet of cheats by your side. Rival gangs would always initiate the shooting, which is fun and challenging, almost daring you to step into their territories. But what is there to be scared of? Claude is a badass silent character, and weirdly enough, he takes part in a Scarface-Esque storyline with a lot of openly-talked characters, he never has to say anything, maybe he has already seen everything.
The storyline isn't anything overly complicated of thoughts provoking, but it doesn't make it any less bombastic, most of the missions involve driving all sorts of vehicles the most with some aspect of shooting, the latter is a bit stiff, coming from the modern take of shooters, it does feel out of place, we're talking about a game that has no cover system, no button that enables crouching and no level grinding weapon system that advances the more you play. There is a relatively small collection of weapons in the game, not a lot of praise here, however, the gore is not trying to be any less subtle, I don't see this in modern games, but the sight of shooting people in precise body joins can sever their limbs, heads or blow them up altogether, crazy how the technology was all there from way back.

I appreciate the spacious game map, it spans two major cities with a respectable size, and two small/medium islands in the sides, all being opened to you to visit as you progress through the game's mission. I like how the map has a very low learning curve to memorize, very easy to navigate and just after a few hours of playing.

I feel like reviewing any of the GTA games, it's always worth having a separate paragraph to talking about the phenomenal hilarious radio stations that come with the games, some times, I would just launch the game, enter a car and scroll through the collection of radio stations and just listen to them at my leisure time, and to be honest, the radio stations alone deserve the full price of the game. A lot of land-marking songs from the '80s, hilarious radio show talks that never get old, it's all a good time.

For what was a game I just had to grind through to fill the hungry completionist nature that would agonize me if I hadn't gone through the first games before advancing to the more modern ones, I had a blast playing this classic. It's always nice to visit the older generation of games, after all, old doesn't mean bad, there are older games that hold more value than a game that will be released in 20 years from now could ever have. Between the driving, the story, the police chases and of course, the cheat codes, GTA III holds decently even nowadays.",1566817231,1566817231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Just simple 2-3 minute missions consisting of go whack this guy or jack that car but to be fair to the game, in 2001 this was revolutionary and for that reason alone this game must and should be considered one of the all time greats in the Open World category. 

In my opinion, it's a game that should only be played if you have either completed or none of the later open world games available interest you.

Ofcourse graphics are not great anymore and game has it´s flaws but overall I recommend to play it through atleast once.
Story is great once you get on it and there is really lots of things to do as always in GTA.
It took me around 30hours to get 100% completion and game is around 5-10euros so i call it worth to buy.

Pros:
+Story is good
+Interesting characters
+Lots of different vehicles and even dodo:D
+Many side things to do along with main story

Cons:
-Some parts of game feel little rushed, since some things were removed just before launch
-Game can be really annoying sometimes, and some missions are really hard to complete 
-There is no map so if you are new player, it will take time to know the city
-Few bugs in steam version of game (menus disappear and stuff)

In nutshell: GTA 3 is first 3D game in the series so it has it flaws and not that much content as later ones, but it is still a masterpiece and back in the days one of the best games made. Definetely recommend buying it and giving it a try!

In this sequel, Claude is violently betrayed by his longtime partner Catalina and seeks revenge after being left to die. He now enters the depths of Liberty City to not only reclaim his revenge but status as a cold-blooded criminal rising to mob fame through favors from syndicates and other scum infesting the community.

Unlike its previous notable overhead perspective experience, this installment features vast improvements giving newcomers and previous fans more freedom and extensive exploration. While maintaining its previous arcade style, it still challenges players to navigate stages and missions with every resource at their disposal while using a mini navigator hinting their objectives and other potential interests. The entire landscape of Liberty City is divided into different areas but never feels entirely disconnected even when certain parts are temporarily blocked from exploration.

Players could experience the main story with additional quests to unlock perks to help them thrive and become wealthier. But regardless how much money they earn they're only limited to weapons and immediately loses flair once they've completed enough missions. Also some missions may feel repetitive, as failure is quite constant, and are only available under certain conditions until completion. If players are capable to finish the game without cheating, there's unfortunately not enough extra content that would otherwise initiate instant replay.

Despite these flaws, including having hilariously wonky physics, this installment proved itself to be worth playing for its adventurous storytelling and becoming one of the most entertaining games of all time.",1564006318,1564006318,True,5,0,0.575329959392547607,0,True,False,False,False,

- Looking back at this game it sure brings memories... and nerves. It is a revolutionary game, yet when compared to other great games of that time period (e.g. Mafia a year later) this one is bad. Gameplay is too much arcade. Cars will spin and jump in the air every time you hit something even ever so slightly, aiming is terrible and you loose lives too fast. Alright, so it is a fast paced game but it is also equaly as maddening. Many missions are made frustrating just because of these things and the stupid AI. The police will try to ram you as if you were playing a demilition derby. Directions are bad and although there is a minimap, there is no big map that should be viewable in the menu so navigating betweet the islands is sometimes impossible and really annoying. What's more some missions are very poorly explained and it isn's clear what you should do until you mess up. 

- There isn's much of a story as the main guy is mute and does not ever disagree with what he is told to do. He will work for mafia, yakuza and crooked polititians. The whole story is just about how bunch of gangs tossed around this poor mute sociopath to settle their accounts with each other. BUT if you would like to see how some of the characters from San Andreas and Vice City ended up, it's there.",1562866443,1621766586,False,0,3,0,0,True,False,False,False,

- It's GTA.
- Enjoyable story, mission, and side mission.
- HD texture mods are available to use, and its doing a very good job upgrading the old graphic texture.
- Has more content than what i expected.
- Nostalgia.
- One of the game that changed open-world genre.

Cons
- You probably need a fan made patch to even play this game on modern hardware.
- Does not age well, lots of glitch in Steam version. Patchable.
- Broken Aspect ratio when using modern monitor, need a patch to play it in Full HD.
- No built in controller support.
- Wongky physics.
- Extreme glitching when playing the game with more than 85+ fps.

The graphics are somehow better than in VC and SA. The missions are significantly less scripted than in 4 and 5.
The driving is good: the camera keeps up with the car on turns, so you do not need to constantly move the camera with your mouse while driving (like in 4 and 5).
The game is arcade enough, without too much realism, so it is fun to play. (For instance, you can just pick up a ""star"" to shake off the police without a need to hide from them for 5 minutes like in GTA5.)
The city is not that big like in other games of the series, which is a good thing: almost every place has some meaning in the game, e.g. has a mission in it or has a hidden secret.",1561795218,1561795346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

-------------------------------------
The game hasn't aged well in some places, but it's still a good game overall. The storytelling is a bit weak, characters are introduced that completely disappear after a few missions, the physics feel a bit off by today's standards, the minimap isn't all that helpful, and there are some missions that will make you wonder if the game was even playtested before release. Also, playing at higher framerates than 30 tend to break the physics. However, most of this is excusable due to the time the game was made. It was their first GTA in 3D, they were still figuring things out. The game is best played with mods that bring some quality of life changes to the game, such as a full map view. The game is still worth revisting today as a look back to how the open world genre of today got its start, but maybe not for 10 dollars. If you really want to buy GTA III, wait for a sale. If you just want a GTA game to play, and you can't run GTA IV or V, you'd probably be better off getting San Andreas, downgrading it, and installing mods to apply some bug patches not present in the Steam release. From what I've heard, there's also apparently a full conversion of GTA III to San Andreas as well, so if you can find it you could play GTA III with the more polished engine and features of San Andreas. The authentic experience is still a piece of gaming history. Without GTA III, the landscape of games, especially open world games, it would not look the same.",1561406538,1561406538,True,2,1,0.517786562442779541,0,True,False,False,False,

Fantastic games in the GTA Series getting negative reviews because they flat out don't work as they should.

GTA III is a legendary game but this Steam version is extremely broken. Menus go invisible, cars don't go into reverse, and the game crashes at the drop of a feather. Do yourself a favor and buy an old PS2 or PS3 and get the game on there. Heck, even the iOS version is far more functional than this.

EDIT: A few months later, I went back because I felt like revisiting. You are going to need the following mods in order to get this working: 

d3d8.dll from [url=https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9/releases/tag/v1.7.0]here[/url]. 
Put the file in your GTA 3 directory, then turn on V-Sync for gta3.exe in your GPU control panel. Be sure to turn off VSYNC and Frame Limiter in the game's options. If you have a high refresh rate monitor, change your display's refresh rate 60 FPS.

SteamCarColourFix.asi from [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/uus9l55495zh89z/SteamCarColourFix.rar?dl=0]here[/url]. 
Put the file in your GTA 3 directory. Does not require an external asi loader. 

If you want controller support, use [url=https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272]this[/url]. Follow the instructions in the archive on how to install and configure.

FINAL SCORE GAME: 8/10
FINAL SCORE PC PORT: 1/10
IN A NUTSHELL: Yet another one of Rockstar's great games abandoned and left behind.

Сломанная к хуям стрельба (особенно из М16, валящая как обезьяна под спидами, которая и занималась физикой оружия в этой игре), машины уходящие в неуправляемый занос от малейшего дуновения ветра, бетонные кустики об которые ранее упомянутые драндулеты делают кульбит и взрываются не давая выйти (покинуть машину в движении нельзя, остаётся только смотреть как горящий кусок говна совершает свой последний пируэт и попутно рвать волосы на голове), угловатые леджи при спринте с коих ГГ делает непреднамеренный квантовый прыжок прямиком в смерть (проблема исключительно нефиксированного фреймрейта, но в 15 фпс я играть отказываюсь), охуительные миссии в духе ""снеси 9 лотков с кофе, но где - мы тебе не скажем, они раскиданы по всей доступной карте, дерзай"" или ""продержись на 6 звёздах 3 минуты"". Вишенкой на торте из кала, как это бывает, является последняя миссия, где отобрав всё оружие, игра бросает против тебя позолоченную орду колумбийцев и босса-вертолёта (сбрасывающего бомбы тебе на голову, разумеется), который ещё долгие месяцы будет сниться мне в кошмарах. Кстати, сюжета тут нет от слова совсем. Есть кое-как связанные между собой задания, где Клода посылают сделать штуку X без какого-либо понимания нахуй герой должен этим заниматься, в чём конечная цель и что он по этому поводу думает. Немой протагонист - это наихудшее решение для криминальной драмы, где нарратив непременно повязан вокруг характера и амбиций главного героя, которых у Клода просто нет.  

В целом, по ходу игры у меня сложилось стойкое ощущение, что игру банально не успели доделать. Она по всем параметрам уступает Вайс Сити и, в отличие от него же, абсолютно не проходит проверку временем. Ностальгические очки и отговорки про технологический прорыв в жанре не канают. Трёшке нечего предложить игроку кроме местами зубодробительной сложности, достигнутой самым идиотским способом, а именно - ебучим рандомом и мясом. 

P.S. Дробовик попаданием в упор сносит машину одним выстрелом мгновенно и без горения, что ставит крест на попытке спокойно проехать по району с мафией, где проходят и выполняются сюжетные миссии. Попадание полностью зависит от удачи: спавн хуесоса с дробовиком может случиться в метре от того, где проезжает игрок. Если это не ёмко говорит о глубине проработки геймдизайна, то я не знаю что. Надеюсь того, кто сознательно оставил эту потрясающую деталь в игре отправили на принудительную лоботомию.

P.P.S. В ИГРЕ НЕТ ПОЛНОЦЕННОЙ КАРТЫ! ПОЧЕМУ?! Вайс Сити вышла всего на год позже. Я не верю, что это была настолько революционная идея даже для 2001 года.",1560452074,1560456410,False,1,0,0.489893347024917603,0,True,False,False,False,

[b]Grand Theft Auto 3[/b], for PC

Rating: [b]8.2/10[/b]; Great

Highly recommended for fans of GTA, though if you have not played any similar games you may want to play a later game instead of this one.


Grand Theft Auto 3 is a third person shooting and driving game which pretty much created the genre of “GTA clone”.  The story is not bad, though it is nothing amazing.  What is amazing is the ambiance and world building that make the game world seem like a real city with real people.  Everything from the way random pedestrians and drivers act and speak to the in game radio stations, signs and places to visit.  It is fairly common to see random npc behaviour cause vehicle accidents or crimes which can result in emergency vehicles being summoned.

The basic gameplay has you go around on foot with some simple running and jumping, and the ability to melee, shoot and get in and out of vehicles.  The console version features an annoying control scheme where the character must first turn in the direction you want him to move, rather than sidestepping or backpedalling.  Most guns also use an auto target lock system instead of allowing free aim.  The PC version allows you to use the console movement and shooting control scheme, or one more typical of a shooter (which has no auto targeting).  The shooting is poor though because only the sniper rifle and RPG allow precise single shots.  For all other guns, you must hold down the shoot button and fire the gun as fast as possible because of the time delay between the normal stance and shooting stance before a shot is fired.  This delay has a pretty good chance of getting you killed if you try and pick your shots or conserve ammo.

Where the game shines is with the driving.  With multiple camera views to choose from, solid controls and different performance for different vehicles, the sheer act of driving around the city is tons of fun just by itself; regardless of whether or not you obey traffic laws.  On top of this, you get high speed chases, vehicle combat, racing, jumps and other cool things to do with your vehicles.  The open world nature also makes each play session and repeated mission attempts different, because traffic and pedestrians are random.  Most missions allow you to bring whatever vehicle you want, or to switch to new vehicles you find, which can have tactical implication for the mission.

However despite how great the core gameplay is, there are a number of minor issues that bring the game down.  The most annoying part of the game is how rival gangs become hostile and their randomly and infinitely respawning members on the street shoot at you the instant they see you, regardless of what you are doing or driving.  They must have magic or something.  This is not a huge deal by itself, but when they have shotguns you will be faced with many sudden and random deaths.  You see, for some reason shotguns are comparable to other guns when damaging people, but they can VERY quickly destroy vehicles.  It is more like a mini RPG launcher.  I find it hard to believe that this made it past quality control as something that is acceptable and fun for a game.  

There are several other poor design decisions that make the game less fun.  The lack of a map in the pause menu makes it very obnoxious to get around.  Even when I was near the end of the game and I knew my way around fairly well, sometimes I still had to drive around for a couple minutes to figure out where exactly I was and wanted to go.  It was especially annoying to have a timed objective and be unable to check a bigger map to see where it was.  Also extremely annoying was the lack of map icons for ammunition, pay n spray and other useful things (unless going there was needed for a mission).  This made it harder than necessary to do routine things (like get more ammo) and is made even worse by the fact that the map icons exist in the game, but are just not used.

Despite its flaws, this is an amazing game which is well worth every hour played, even if those hours are spent just running or driving around rather than doing any structured activities.


Pro [list]
[*]Fairly good story and dialogue
[*]Very immersive world with npc dialogue, activity, behaviour etc.  Plenty of interesting things to observe simply by standing around and watching the world
[*]Option to use WSAD style movement (where left and right strafe, and back backpedals), or console GTA style movement (where you first turn in the direction you want to go)
[*]Good driving, with solid controls, variable performance for each vehicle and surface
[*]Vehicles display damage, and based on where the damage occurred
[*]Game does not end
[*]Large variety of things to do besides story missions
[*]Decent enemy AI, especially when they are driving
[/list]
Con [list]
[*]Jumping over things (like walls) is harder than it should be
[*]Cannot change weapons while game is paused (it often takes too long to select the weapon you want), which is made worse by…
[*]Inability to run with most weapons, and only the weakest allow running
[*]No reloading until the current clip is empty
[*]Bad shooting (except sniper rifle and rpg), where there is such a delay between pressing the shoot button and the guy shooting that you have to hold down the button and fire full auto all the time (or semi auto as fast as possible for guns which are not full auto)
[*]No ability to melee with guns (especially noticeable when random pedestrians start punching you during a rocket launcher rampage)
[*]Grenades/molotovs cannot be aimed and are thus very difficult to throw.  Also very high chance of hurting yourself
[*]Hostile gang members that infinitely respawn and shoot at you regardless of what you are doing.  The ones with shotguns are extremely overpowered and WAY too easily destroy vehicles
[*]Some activities (mainly paramedic) end if you get out of the vehicle.  I did accidentally press “f” to exit the vehicle on paramedic level 11
[*]Many missions and activities have unforgiving time limits.  While I like the pressure to drive both fast and safely, some of the time limits are way too short
[*]One mission about following a trail of porn magazines which has such a bad time limit that I finished it with 1 second remaining after 10+ attempts
[*]Collectables and minor missions do not show up on the map.  It is too hard to find them and keep track of what you have done
[*]No large map in game (which makes it obnoxiously difficult to find things and get around)
[*]Map icons are only occasionally present during some missions.  Things like the safe house, pay n spray, ammo store, hospitals, police stations etc should always show on the map
[*]Mini map automatically changes zoom based on how fast you are going.  Given the lack of main map, I would want max zoomed out all the time
[*]Third island is poorly designed.  Why is there no shortcut leading from the airport area to the safe house area?
[*]Can’t swim (you drown instead)
[*]Can only save at safe houses
[*]People cannot take damage while inside a car (no shooting people through windows)
[*]Money is not used for much, and you can use other means to get armor and weapons.  Money is more like a score
[*]Police attention is extremely unrealistic.  Things like speeding, driving on the wrong side or sidewalk, ignoring stop signs and traffic lights, accidents, and killing people with vehicles do not get attention (you have to kill a lot of people).  Killing someone with a gun, accident with police vehicle, assaulting police and stealing police vehicles only give minor attention.  These things should give more police attention to make the game more challenging and encourage legal driving for important missions.  Driving a tank should give automatic max police attention
[*]Cannot replay missions
[*]Escort mission where the ally driver got stuck in an alley and I had to kill him and try again

GTA 3 is my first game to play into the series and sadly while I never played the first two games, I did saw gameplay of the games to at least analyze GTA’s style from a 2D game to a 3D game. Perhaps I may get to play and maybe review it but so far it has really aged a lot and the sky camera view is not very appealing in my opinion. I will warn you this, I may get a little bias on my review only because I have not played the previous GTA games and running this game is hard on my pc, so bugs and features may conflict on the review because I had to put a patch to run on my pc. Of course, I always try to be impartial with my reviews and try to see the best in every game as possible, hope you all enjoy the review.

[h1]From Small Time to BIG time [/h1]

	For people who grew up with the first two GTA games on the ps1, I will assume they did enjoy the game with its interesting mature style of the game of stealing cars, picking up a prostitute and shooting down police. I can only assume this is where they are starting to get some attention from the media, but not as impactful as GTA 3 later down in 2001.  For me when I see GTA 1-2 it looked more of an indie game because of its simple premise and gameplay compare to other game classics like Super Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot or Metal Gear. This is why those games aren't talked about as much as the 3D counterpart of GTA. 

Usually when I hear people talked about their first experience in GTA is usually the third game they get thrilled to bring up their experience (and San Andreas or Vice City but we’ll get there) on playing these classics. For a technical perspective, this was pretty revolutionary given how 3D open world was starting to become popular in video games. From a 2D into a 3D world of Liberty city and the things you can do in, there is quite a breathtaking the old and new fans alike….until the news media shows up and talked about it. 

I am surprised they are aware of the stupidity and hypocrisy some people see in their game and can turn it into good satire. Hell they dedicate a whole radio station in the game mocking of America’s culture of their stupidity. They even make fun of the violent video game portion before the news even begin to criticize them! That is what I call a company who are way ahead of the time.

[h1]Welcome to Liberty City: Impressions[/h1]

The city is very impressive for the time, though now the game has age because of the bugs it has; okay texture on buildings, characters/lore, and the gameplay. Though in the first hours I did enjoy the city of Liberty city, I don’t know why but playing it really felt I am living in 2001 the atmosphere is there yet I have never even touched that game when I was young. Cruising around the city is enjoyable while listening to some good radio music is relaxing. Not to mention running down people for LOL and get chased by cops was the most fun experience in the first hours of the game. Unfortunately, that ends here because I will explain later in another section that the gameplay drags my experience down.

 The story is not something to consider a classic since the main protagonist Claude is really the emptiest silent protagonist alive and the characters while they are charming they aren’t memorable in my book. Yes, compare the transition to GTA 2 to 3, this is considered a fitting transition to take in new fans while not scaring the old once, heck they even brought back the sky camera view if people are not fond of the third person view. I just think the pacing of the story seems a bit fast since in the beginning you just bail out of jail by your buddies and ten seconds later is “business as usual.” 

There isn’t much time to be invested with those characters because you are busy doing missions for them. Sad thing is that they are not to be trusted because one mission you are friends with them, the next they stab you in the back and you stab them in the back in another mission. The funniest part is that Claude’s reaction to all this backstabbing and alliance making he is like “yeah I'm cool with that.” His looks is all I don’t give a hoot as long as I complete my mission. Some characters try to hook up with Claude as if they know him but I’m sitting here like “do I care enough to care?” Oh well, I heard it will improve over the next few installments and this one considers the last “classic” of the first two.

[h1]Better catch me Cops!: Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay and missions are fun in the first few hours but the game just drags me down with the uphill difficulty which is not my main issue of this game is the lack of fairness it has into completing certain missions. The game has no map or sense of directions you will get easily lost in this big city you are in which I don’t know why sometimes the icons appear to follow but sometimes it doesn’t as if the game just gave up and said: “eh, figure the rest of them out.” Which is a shame because a third of the game is time-trial missions and you are constantly running the clock, getting lost and cops/gangs ram you over.  Sure, there are side missions and mini-games to be entertained but the main missions are alright nothing super exciting. 

You better pray to get out of the car as soon as possible because there is no mid-air control so you better stop the car now or die. Firing weapons is so frustrating because the pistol and submachine gun you can run, but you are force to station when you get the better weapons so enemies began to easily shoot you! 

Gangs automatically go aggressive on you so if you want to go to a section of the map you better pray they don’t shoot you enough to make your vehicle explode immediately after you arrive!  Graphics rendering gets delay if you are far away given to the limitation it has but is bad because if you leave your vehicle far away it disappears. Better pray if your special vehicles don’t get destroy because if it did is gone for good. You can’t fly helicopters which cops use them but you can fly a dodo plane which sucks on getting to the air, so don’t try to get it across the ocean because Claude can’t swim.

[h1] Buy or Don’t buy?[/h1]

It has its frustrating moments on the gameplay side and the okay story-line, but for its time it’s alright to look back and appreciate what made the GTA series great. Do I think you should start with this game? Perhaps, only to enjoy what it is and not looked down on it because of the graphics. This is a 6.5 in my book, is not slightly above average but is not very good either in terms of fun. I’m sure when I get to Vice City it will be even more fun but for this, this is considered a successful experiment on Rock Star’s part in making the series mainstream of today.

If you never actually played GTA before, most people will tell you to ""just play Vice City or San Andreas"". But while I do believe that the following games vastly improved what GTA III achieved at the time, its quirks and rough edges have a pretty distinct charm that is impossible to replicate.

Anyway, assuming that you are already know how much of a big deal this game was - and is - let's go for the ugly:

[list]
[*] I think everyone is aware by now that this port is hot garbo, right? And MAN, is it a chore to get this thing to run properly on Windows 10.

First of all, [url=https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/]Silent Patch[/url] is a must. It actually makes the PC version worth playing, since it fixes countless glitches and oversights. If you want widescreen support (you do), download [url=https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gta3]ThirteenAG's widescreen fix[/url]. If you want full controller support (you do), download [url=https://gtaforums.com/topic/562765-ginput/]GInput[/url].

As always, [url=https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III]PC Gaming Wiki[/url] will give you a step-by-step guide. [spoiler] Isn't it cool when developers completely abandon their older games? Massive kudos to the GTA community for keeping this game alive and kicking. [/spoiler]

[*] You cannot control the camera while using the classic control scheme. Not really. Just mentioning this because there seems to be some confusion regarding this issue online.

[*] Game's locked at 30 FPS, and if you unlock it, the physics go mental. So that's fun.

[*] It's kinda hard, but in the wrong way. You know that early-2000's ""that's bullshit"" kinda hard? That's the one. This is largely due to the fact that the auto aim is, well, atrocious - which [i]can[/i] be a turn off at the very beggining, when all of your weapons suck. Fortunately, the PC version includes a free-aim option. It's not a 100% functional, but it's there.

[*] Price is a bit salty for a game that's almost two decades old. Would highly recommend to get it on a sale.

Firstly, the menus are invisible, which is fixed by shift+tabbing repeatedly until the brightness inches its way up to what is visible. Once you click on a menu option, however, the entire thing resets and you must shift+tab again to be able to see it. 

Another huge issue I have is with the framerate. The game does not force you to use the frame limiter, but in order for it to be semi-functional you must. This caps the game at around 30 fps, which is unplayable. If you turn the frame limiter off, the game freezes, crashes, and the menus break more frequently.

- It's always fun to go on a sandbox rampage.
- The radio stations.
- Still a charming city/map.
- Still works without any modifications.

Cons:
- The graphics are atrocious. Hasn't aged well. Should be apparent.
- The controller support is awful. Shooting is terribly difficult and inaccurate. Funny thing: It's even worse with M+KB.
- The game doesn't automatically save your progress. You have to go to a safe house to do that. Can get pretty tiresome. Luckily it didn't crash even once for me.
- The missions are hit and miss...some are extremely frustrating.
- No map view and no GPS system, so have fun finding your target if you're a bit lost or simply don't know where to go. This often results in a mission restart when the mission is timed.
- Frequent loss of character control. When hit with shotguns or punched for example.
- Can't swim...water = death
- The story is actually not even that good. Typical revenge plot in the end. And the missions don't really string together all that well. Feels like a lot of progression is missing. I felt a bit lost at times.
- The voice acting and sound effects are terrible. And the mixing is cruel as well.
- Why is everyone always in my way?! ;)
- Bugs.
- Mod support on Steam is terrible for this game.


No, seriously, if you want to play this game in 2019 for whatever reason (for me it was nostalgia) do yourself a favour and get a trainer. Or unlimited patience.

Not to mention I had to find new ones casually finding them when passing by them.

Grand Theft Auto III is the more or less revolutionary, third major entry into the open-ended criminal sandbox game series, spanning from 1997's original top down entry. You play as an unnamed man in this game - later games give him the name of Claude - who seeks revenge from their former partner in crime after they betrayed and left them for dead during a job gone wrong.

By today's standards the game looks positively... poor, but for a 2001 title in an industry still reluctantly stepping into full-fledged 3D graphics, it was astonishing. Nevertheless, character models are pretty obviously composed of separated segments that are animated as need be, often wonkily and even in cutscenes, and while the draw distance is impressive for a game of its age, props and entities still obviously spawn just a short distance ahead of where you look. Small details litter the game world and help in grounding you into its satirical yet dreary and hostile-feeling atmosphere, but it does little when the big picture itself looks dated.

Audio is notably low quality, especially for voice acting, but there is good variety in sound effects, from weapons to vehicles. The radio feature remains a (relatively speaking, anyway) unspoken-of piece of brilliance: 9 radio stations, featuring a wide range of musical genres, and one hilarious talk radio show, to be listened to from any civilian vehicle. Unlike future entries, the humour in dialogue is toned down during mission cutscenes, and mostly relegated either to the radio or to random passerbys spouting nonsense on the streets.

Gameplay is understandably the meat of the game. As a transition from the top-down gameplay to full 3D, some quirks remain to tide over players of the original games, including an optional top-down camera view not seen in any future mainline games, gaining money for fender benders and exploding cars, and the protagonist actually being mute and only partaking in one-way conversations with people, generally to receive mission objectives. The missions have fair variety in delivery of a narrow set of objectives, but quickly become [b]annoying[/b]. Future GTA games are graced with things like a map screen, waypoints, more detailed and clear objectives and locations, autosaves, journey skips and mid-mission checkpoints. This game has none of that bar a useful but really restricted minimap in the corner, which doesn't even have a good coloring scheme to distinguish water from roads or tunnels. 

Missions are also made that much more annoying by being given no indication of which missions permanently disable performing others until you fulfill them or consult a walkthrough.. nor that, as the storyline progresses, gangs become permanently hostile with you, including a mafia wielding very dangerous weapons that can blow your car up or knock you out to the hospital in a few seconds. You also have a (barebones, by modern GTA standards) list of side activities to perform that reward you with in-game money and additional perks, ranging from being a taxi driver, ambulance driver or ""vigilante"" officer (providing a souped-up cab, health pickups and wanted level clearing bribes, respectively), to entering certain vehicles parked in specific locations that trigger minigames, and the usual assortment of ""hidden package"" collectibles that grant an ever expanding armory at your safehouses, which is a godsend when seemingly every other mission wants to screw you over in a flaming wreck, or just end you from onslaughts of enemies who can stun you out of shooting a tiny bit (a lot if shotgun) when you get hit.

For smaller things that can throw off even established players of newer GTA games, a big one is the car handling. They have a much wider range of variation in stats (who'd have thought a lowly looking estate can turn so quickly?) but most end up feeling like they can tip over from just taking a corner at moderate velocity. There's also NO MID-AIR CAR CONTROL, which screws you over 9 times out of 10 if you take a jump or fall badly. Land on your roof? You better crawl out of there fast. You also cannot dive out of a moving car, so you have to come to a stop - again, even as it's about to blow up. All vehicles have much more vague damage indication: while body panels come off with the slightest touch and isn't too unusual for GTA games of its era, vehicles will get some puffs of white smoke coming from the engine after unspecified and seemingly random amounts of damage... then at some point finally go ""oh it's fire now, better run"", with no further warning of a vehicle's damage state. Weapons have a progression system which amounts to: the pistol is useless the moment you get an Uzi, which is almost useless the moment you get an AK, which is thoroughly useless the moment you get an M16, which is only a notch below the Bazooka, and the shotgun is a poor man's Bazooka for up to 15ft (and also Claude's kryptonite).

Oh yeah, and you can't swim. The action takes place in and around two islands and one mainland segment, and boats are finnicky enough to line up to jetties and hop off as it is, so there's that.

There is easily content for dozens of hours of play in one go, and possibly hundreds more if you're bent on completing the coveted 100% Completion checklist, but this game is not for the faint of heart. Even having played newer titles in the series, III is a monster of its own. Its scale is much smaller and its delivery confusing/confused, but you'll be flipping walkthrough pages the most for this game.

Grand Theft Auto III is an infamous game developed and published by Rockstar Games and is the third game in the Grand Theft Auto franchise

The game has some really nice environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out, especially for when the game came out

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game has some poor performance issues so a fan-made fix is easily found online to fix what should have been the developers job, but Rockstar Games apparently hates PC so...

Grand Theft Auto III overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good open world action game to play!

^Otherwise, skip it. Seriously. I mean it. #GTAevolution

Classic GTA. 

For me... Much nostalgia! Brings me back.
The first GTA I played... I never beat it though... 
I played it on PS2... It sadly crashed a lot...

There are only a couple of things that are good. The funny
NPC lines like, ""young man"", ""there's no need to feel down"",
etc, in reference to the YMCA song and these lines are
spoken by black dude the builder who is obviously gay...

Apart from that... It's really just nostalgia. Basically, you're 
definitely not missing out on anything by skipping this one.

Other good stuff: Atmosphere and car radio.

Yes, it's... A good game... *takes nostalgia goggles off* 
Well, not as good as the more modern GTAs for sure. 
A little bit outdated but yeah... But 'tis still a good game... 

Install some mods though and it's even better. 
That takes some combination of effort and patience though!
Is it worth it? Probably not.

Being totally honest though... It's old and it's frustratingly 
hard... And you know how a mission failed goes in any GTA 
game... You're made to drive all the way back to the mission start. 

-_-

That's gonna happen a lot.

Just... Be prepared. Better yet... Lemme give you a hand.

(I'm also pasting these here for my own future reference)

GUNSGUNSGUNS = Weapon Cheat 
IFIWEREARICHMAN = Money Cheat

BANGBANGBANG = Blow Up Cars Around You

They don't help enough though if I'm honest.

( [b] EDIT: [/b] This trainer here is fully functional and provides some useful things like, unlimited health/ammo and indestructible cars, etc. Now you might actually be able to complete the game without slitting your wrists lol: https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=58401 )

Things I really don't like: Cars damage way too easily (one little bump
and the hood of your car is gone), missions are unimaginitive/repetitive, 
controls/combat clunky, driving sucks, police are absolutely bonkers, etc.
Oh, and an infinite number of constantly respawning gang members which 
try to kill you while you're doing a mission and who make it 10x harder than
it has to be. That 'Turismo' (racing) mission, for example. I'm remembering
why I never completed this game all those years ago lol. F u cking terrible.

Sounds like any other GTA... Right? Believe me... All's worse in GTA III...

Oh noes. The nostalgia has worn off. At least now you have the truth.

[b] Recommended mods [/b]

1. CLEO (I can't remember what this is exactly but I think it's required to use some mods)

2. GInputIII 1.11 by Silent (awesome mod that enables you to use your Xbox 360 controller)

I do not want to say that the game as such is bad, I am sure you will enjoy a lot of fun while doing missions or just cruising around the city. However, I cannot get rid of the impression that game developers were pushed by deadlines and simply did not have time to fine tune the game and so in some cases they were forced to delete content or find shortcuts to problems that required a lot of time. I think that the most notorious Rockstar´s shortcut is a main character Claude Speed, who does not talk and it even when dying. If you are willing to accept such budget cuts and only focus on the storyline, you will surely enjoy the game.

The game wasn't made for modern operating systems I understand that and this was way before the likes of Windows 7 and Windows 10 were even thing but that doesn't excuse the issues I've faced;

1. If you display resoultion is 1920x1080 for example like my current resoultion is, this game is going to launch at a whopping low resoultion, you need to install additonal fixes made by users with free time on their hands if you want to fix this issue and good luck if that even fixes anything, even after installing the supposed fixes I'm still facing issues. 

2. When you get to the Main-Menu (where the load, new game buttons are etc) the entire menu is completly invisible... as in you can't see any text but you can still highlight the menu buttons where they should be if this damn game was working as it was suppose to. 

3. Audio SFX at main menu missing or broken but with the supposed fix I installed when pausing the game during Gameplay the Audio SFX works fine for the time being. 

4. I don't know If it's to do with the GTA3 Steam fix I installed but whatever the hell it is and what's causing It is definitely annoying, Car colours are broken and all of the cars seem to be dark black or dark, no I didn't enter the cheat code for all black cars if there is one for GTA3. 

I have an older retail version of GTA3 that worked fine on an old Windows 8.0 computer a couple of years ago without fuss or issue but I simply purchased this for convience. My advice if you have a modern computer & system is to avoid this game and don't bother applying fixes, it's a waste of time and after applying them your still faced with more issues. 

If you have an older computer running the likes of XP or below then you shouldn't have trouble running this game unless the steam version much more terrible than what I truely think it is. If the steam version still runs terrible on older systems then just go buy yourself a retail version (hoping it'll be 1.0) and request a refund out of this game. If it requires so many additonal hoops and fixes just to play the game and it's still buggy you should be entitled to a full refund.

That being said, this is probably my favourite GTA. I loved GTA SA, but GTA III holds a special place in my heart as both the first GTA I've ever played (back in the day on PS2), as well as the first 3D GTA. Sure, it's a little unrefined here and there, with glitches and mildly irritating missions, but the storyline is very interesting and engaging (more-so once you're done with Portland) even though the protagonist is silent. The gameplay is fantastic, there's plenty to see and do. Yes, the graphics are dated, but they look pretty good for being made in 2002. After 10 mins in game, you won't notice anyways. 

This game is a homerun in my book, along with the other 2 entries into the 3D era of GTA (III, VC & SA). But on top of it all, this is also the game we have to thank, because it gave us GTA:VC, GTA:SA, GTA IV, etc. 

Even today, it's worth every cent. Tied with GTA:SA for the best anything that Rockstar's ever released.

I really am not sure about this game.
It kinda sucks but it is amazing on the other hand.

As we all know GTA is an open world third person shooter and so on.
But GTA 3 is the first title of Grand Theft Auto in 3D perspective.
It is literally the beginning of GTA as we all know it today and it feels great to dig into the roots and see how it all started

Technically it is a mess compared to todays games, you cant really beat it without loading a save. 
You die, mission failed all weapons gone, all of them expensive af. You even have to pay to do missions like 500k once. You die, the money is gone. 
Have fun gathering it all again with taxi missions and what else you can do. 2k in 5 minutes. You would have to grind for every try and sometimes 4 tries are normal.
You cant sprint as well and the aim on range is a huge mess, you have to aim a little right and a little bit dow to hit the target.
The lack of a cover or even sneak mechanics hurts and there is no map. I got used to remembering everything you know you get it after a while. There are some significant spots like e.g. central park.
So the map is missing but thats ok. 
The physics are funny how your car jumps up when crashing into people and it feels weird but you get used to it as well
But think about when it came out. 2001. I rember trying this game very hard on my first real smartphone 14 years later.
I didnt even make it to the second Island back then and thinking about the pain even on pc makes me think how I even enjoyed it like that on a phone. It really was horrible due to the buttons on the screen and in your fov...
But I see that it was the best way possible and it was a hell lot of fun I can tell you that.

The graphics are so classic. Dont break the game down on its graphics its just nostalgic and it feels like an open world max payne 1...
It was such a huge jump back then. 
Compared to now it looks edgy, flat and grey af. Its funny to see the propably first lens flares in game history. I really can imagine how everyone was like: ""wooow"" in 2001.

The story is lame but fun.
It is like ""I dont fckn care about your shit"" when you play it today because it simply cant bring up tension, we are all supersaturated because of AAA cutscenens and movie like action that this would be crap if it came out 2017.
But it is so much fun going all the way down to the toilets in central park to meet a corrupt cop in there whos been waititing for you exactly there for days.
And these faces that look all the same. Also the feeling of beating missions by tricking the game somehow, taking advantage of bugs, driving the dodo like a car on the streets of LC and so on.
I really love it just because of memorys and that feels great. Its just part of me somehow, I couldnt let go on that.

And you have not lived until you flew the dodo all the way over to the ghost town :)

So I recommend this game for everybody who wants to check out GTAs roots. Everybody who knows it from his childhood wouldnt read this review because he knows the game.
If you want all your action, fun and nice grafics and high end quality you should look for something else .

Take this with a pinch of salt since I did  use some essential mods to run the game on my modern system as well as add controller support.

Graphics

So I kept these unmodded and I have to say visually it is stunning. However, the game was released in 2002 when widescreen wasn't really a thing, so the widescreen option will just stretch the whole image rather than actually rendering the game at the proper resolution, but this can be fixed with a simple google search for ""widescreen fix"". 

Anyway, the visuals set a dark and rough tone consistent with the game's theme. it hasn't aged well over the years but being able to customize the PC version a little bit I really enjoyed the option to disable trails. Trails is a very early implementation of motion blur and it does look cool when driving fast, but most of the time can be frustrating and even a little nauseating. Maxing out the draw distance (which if you can handle windows 10, you can definitely handle!) allows you to see from one island to another, no more heavy fog which was used on consoles to optimize the hardware. Even with this in mind, the xbox version is superior graphically as it features much better reflections, models and textures.

Audio

Radios are a little bare compared with Vice City, but there's definitely a radio for everyone. 80s, 90s, Gangster Rap, Techno, Drum n Bass/Garage etc. theres some songs from scarface, the classic radio suiting the mafia vibe too.

Gunshots echo in the streets as escaping engines roar and panicked screams fill the air. It's wild, violent and beautiful all at the same time. all of this great sound design lays out the foundations of GTA's 3D games starting right here.

Gameplay

The world is your oyster, you can do anything you want! be a taxi driver, a paramedic or a vigilante. or just beat the crap out of that old lady. she looked at me funny i swear! but yeah, it's good old sandbox fun. GTA 3 practically invented it, probably. Must admit, that it does get really difficult should you really really annoy the police or get far into the story missions.

Driving AI is pretty decent, civilians come to a dead stop if you are in front of them, they awkwardly swerve should they hear an emergency siren, and anyone hostile to you will plow into you until you're dead.

On foot though! oh boy. they get stuck on absolutely everything should they have to follow you. I did discover a few other minor bugs such as standing in certain places when a cutscene triggers can get you stuck out of bounds until you restart, without a way to save. rest in peace.

In conclusion, this game is absolutely amazing for its time and is well worth checking out if you've enjoyed modern GTA tites. It'll require a bit of tweaking if you're on a modern system and you'll need some essential mods such as silentpatch otherwise the game will ask for disc 2 when you start it, or that it couldnt find video mode 640x480 or something. I'd really recommend checking out PCGamingWiki and their article for GTA III if you want to get this running or are having any issues.

Now you can still manage however going even from GTA VICE CITY back to this is very noticeable. The fact that the main character does not talk at all is very odd and just brings down the story in general. Not many other choices like the other gta games either.

But, not too long ago I revisited this game. I loved most of the game while playing it. Although the game does have some problems, which I was probably too ignorant to realize when I was younger. (I just want to go on record saying that I have beaten all of the missions). There is one Asuka mission in particular at the end of the game that is a real pain in the a**. Some of you might know what im talking about, but for those who dont im talking about the infamous, Expresso 2 Go mission. Im quoting GTA Wiki here, ""Cruise Liberty's districts to find Espresso-2-Go stalls and destroy them."" Now, this might not seem too difficult. But when you destroy your first expresso stand the timer starts ticking down, and you have to find the espresso stands yourself (the map doesn't tell you where the stands are). This means you have to drive around blindly looking for the stands. Thats bad enough but if you ram into the first 3 espresso stands your car catches on fire, and you're forced to get out, unless you want to kill yourself and fail the mission. Once you get out of your wrecked car you better find a replacement quick or else you lose precious time. There are 9 stands that you have to destory in total 5 on Staunton Island,   2 on Shoreside Vale, and another 2 on Portland. When you destroy an espresso stand you dont get any extra time or anything extra, the time continues to tick down, if you destroy all of the stands on an island you dont get any extra time either, this means once you take down all the stands on an island, you need to know where the nearest bridge or tunnel system is or you will waste some more precious time looking around for one. Overall the game is aight but the mission is f*****g donkey a** p***y likin dog d**k monkey c**k p***s s**t.

P.S. An easier way to do the mission is to find the stalls beforehand so they show up on the map, and go to portland to destroy the first stall, so you can destroy the stalls in a sort of sequence",1535074486,1535074486,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False,False,

The only thing i knew how to do was get the pistol that was on the bridge at the start of the game. and because i had no idea how to get to other missions, i replayed the same mission over again, which is why i actually called the game ""you better drive brother"" instead of gta because at the start of the game when you are on the bridge, that was what he would say. It would be fair to say this game was my childhood. 

So after i saw you could download it on steam i instantly bought it. That's where the problem began.

It wouldn't let me launch the actual game and instead would just crash. I had to enable direct x 9 and in doing so completely ruined my pc where the resoluton would remain in 640x480 so i had to reset my pc. 

If you are planning on buying this game with a computer above direct x 9 i wouldnt bother.

[b]The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game and my own personal judgment and rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler free, so you don't need to worry about that either.[/b]

[h1][b]Gameplay and Movement Controls (18 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Let's first get this out of the way, this was the very first 3D GTA game and the developers did a pretty darn good job at it. Yes, you can't use your mouse to look around while driving. Yes, the movement controls are not as precise as they can be with some minor problems here and there. If you're expecting flawless gameplay experience and excellent control response that we have come to expect from modern games, you won't by any means get that in this game. This is a timeless classic and there are many problems with the movement where you'll more often than not find yourself reaching for a sprint or a big map buttons which simply aren't there. Cars are also going to blow up as soon as you hit someone or something a few times. While GTA3 lacks a lot of modern gameplay features it still manages to hold up and deliver an enjoyable experience throughout the entire game. This is a game that set the path for all sandbox and open-world games that came after it.[/b]

[h1][b]Graphics and Sound Quality (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Graphics are great considering that this game came out in the early 2000s. Yes, the texture quality isn't that great but there are a few mods that will help you improve the quality of the textures and graphics in general. GTA 3 has not aged well, and mods that are available out there for this game (are necessary) will take your experience to a whole new level. The soundtrack doesn't include a lot of songs so you will find yourself often listening to the same songs over and over again. Since I'm a big fan of Scarface, there's a radio station called 'flashback' which loops a few songs from the movie which I was listening to 95% of the time. As for the quality of the sound effects and audio in general, it holds up pretty well considering that this came nearly twenty years ago. If it wasn't for mods, I don't know if I'd find the courage to replay the game after all these years. Big thumbs up to the modding community. Voice acting is also perfect in general.[/b]

[h1][b]Performance and Optimization (16 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Oh, here we go. Performance is probably one of the worst things about this game. It really, totally and clearly wasn't meant to be played at framerate above 30. If you unlock the framerate then you're in for some nasty game breaking bugs such as cars not going in reverse, broken physics, crashes before the start of the missions etc. As for the optimization, it's a game that was released on PS2, so... not that demanding, but you can forget about 60 frames-per-second because it ain't happening. You'll be forced to play the game at 25-30 frames-per-second and that's it. I've seen some people locking it to 62 frames-per-second and making it run without problems - but I simply couldn't make it happen. Even locking it to 50 frames-per-second broke the game. Frame locking didn't really make much of a difference for me, they managed to make it playable and enjoyable even on low framerate due to the motion blur they added on top of everything.[/b]

[h1][b]Story and Replayability (14 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]I can't say that the story isn't interesting, but it lacks that feeling that any of the characters are very important. The main character you're playing isn't even talking in the game, which is frustrating, at times. There's not much of replayability either since once you finish the story, there's not much you can do in the open-world of GTA3. There's just one last cutscene which plays out at the end and that's it - onto the credits. After the story finishes you can enjoy the free roam, but I'd rather drive around in GTA: San Andreas if I really have to and if my PC couldn't handle anything more modern.[/b]

[h1][b]Animations and Interaction (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]I would be totally mistaken if I didn't say that the animations are awesome and done perfectly considering the number of resources the developer had at its disposal. There's one thing everyone needs to understand, that being the fact that GTA3 had to be released on the PS2. Interaction is decent, it's true that you don't have the access to a big map of the city, nor do you have any indications as to where are the things located on the map. Sometimes I've found myself driving to one part of the town just to realize that the mission I'm looking for is in a completely different city. That just adds up to the immersion and enjoyment that you have to actually think where you're going instead of just looking at the map all the time. I've just there and then realized how much actually we rely on the mini-map and GPS in modern games that we completely miss what's happening in the world around our characters. I will consider turning off the hud and the maps completely when I play such games from now on.[/b]

[h1][b]Final Score and Conclusion (88 out of 100)[/b][/h1]
[b]As the very first 3D GTA game I must say it's a great experience to see what the developers created from the ground up. I definitely would recommend you picking and playing this game if you haven't already. Since this is once in a lifetime experience for most people, if you finished it a long time ago, go on and jump into it once again to refresh your memories. It's simple, play it, enjoy every second of it and appreciate the fact that GTA3 made way for all the modern sandbox games.[/b]",1533649264,1533649415,True,15,4,0.634590566158294678,0,True,False,False,False,

I still remember playing this one back then during the PS2 era when I was finished with VC and San Andreas just out of curiosity and while I do respect GTA3 for being a genre-defining and completely revolutionary back then, it became obsolete because of its sequels, they improved in every single aspect from GTA 3, unless you want to try it out of curiosity to see what the first 3D GTA game played like go for it, GTA3 is bland, the main character is a mute which is not a bad thing, however after what you saw what the series has become this at first is a huge turn off and the story doesnt help, the gameplay is very primitive compared to what it sequels offer and the lack of vehicle diversity is another annoyance, the mission design is also another flaw, GTA Vice City has made such a HUGE jump after 3 and pretty much set the bar for what future GTA games would be, 3 is not a bad game at all, infact, its a great game, just severely dated and overshadowed by its sequels especially Vice City which was built on the foundation that 3 was set on and went completely above it by imensurable ways, I've tried to finish GTA3 for years and I keep losing interest because of how dated it is and how it doesnt hold a candle to its sequels, which is understandable, I respect it but why I am writing this review ? simple I got the collection because I wanted to play VC and SA again which were my favorites ever and this came with them, so yeah unless youre someone curious about classic GTA stuff go for it, play GTA3 but if you dont want a bland, simplistic experience that got overshadowed by the improvements made in the future games, just ignore it, theres nothing to see in GTA3 at all, it belongs to a museum, youre interested into seeing how the first 3d GTA game is ? watch a video, playing this game is an absolute nightmare, games just like people can age and some do age pretty bad and faster than other games from their same period, just skip this.",1533166112,1654536902,False,5,0,0.558906853199005127,0,True,False,False,False,

I remember getting home from school and rushing to play the game and vent my frustrations of the day on the people of Liberty City, but as I grew up and played GTA 3 from time to time, I realized how good, innovative, and truly remarkable the game was.

I just finished playing it again today and I had always written off the story as inferior to Vice City and San Andreas, but after this latest playthrough, I really like how Dan Houser made all these factions and gangs in the story and how everything in the underworld of Liberty City revolves around the conflicts between these factions. You see some of it in Vice City and in the beginning of San Andreas, but by GTA 4 and GTA 5, the element of gangs and factions and the conflicts between them is largely removed.

GTA 3 plays great on the PC and looks as good as it can for modern times with HD screens and high frames per second. Turning off the frame limiter and driving around has never looked so smooth, it felt like I was playing a totally different game to what I played on the PS2 in 2001. I was surprised at how well it ran on modern PC's, so as long as you're using a Windows 7 or 8 system, I can tell you it should run just fine.

Enemies with sworn alliance unfair AI frequencies and sequences that jump you
a boulder to rage about!

It lifts a floppy area considerably a map with trickling centers that give
you the edge of rolling laughter and nostagia amazement!

The music is generally provided into different genres and its a
subside to alot of notes when the difficulty ramps up into a stable 
of misery spikes hitting your back with a leaning preference!

The gameplay is fun and charming with vehicles that can explode within seconds
and it really gives the challenge hint but i dont like galloping and crippling
graphics that are poorly designed and the simple minded gameplay can be frustuating
to alot of gamers!I raged on 20 missions total and it really blew my mind
into fury anger bits of punching a brick wall as i bleed with insanity measures!

Other then that if you like a height of extreme difficulty then this game is
right up your alley and on the list of being one of the best games of all time!

Good controls with blood-sugar servings!
All i can say is the game is dispensing pleasure to the most part!
If you can handle some wrecked gameplay that gives you a head thump
up your bummy apple pants then this game can really give you
a sensation of being a overall classic!

But if you like a game that is decently made to be fair and not complex!
Then pass this one up,play vice city or some other grand theft auto
to bitter your flexing tastes!

I give this game a 8.7/10 its good but i wish they took more time

I understand why I didn't think it was that good because I've played most of the newest ones and they have changed a lot.

Another big problem is, when you leave  Portland and do the first mission for the Yakuza, It is sooo dangerous to go back to that island because everybody is trying to kill you, but I guess its better than what it used to be, because one group doesn't have shotguns any more they just have micro-SMG's. But; like I said earlier on your cars blow up way to easy so it is a real pain having these groups attacking you. Also, a problem that only bothers me because I've played soo much GTA 5 (460 hours) it is really annoying that you cant flip your car back over. Oh! also a massive problem is the fact that you cant swim and there are so many boat missions, so if you fall in you are going to drown. To finish it's an alright game, the main reason why I had so much trouble with it is that I'm used to the newer GTA's where things are made so much easier for you. I would recommend if you've played other GTA games and not too long on GTA 5, but if you have only played gta5 and spent loads of time on it, then don't buy it unless you really want to.

This game definitely kicked off a trend of open-exploration / ""free control"" games, and it's easy to see why. GTA III wasn't exactly a big focus on the story. You have a good understanding of everything going on, but it's pretty bare-bones and sarcastic with nothing being too important.

And yet, the game is amazing fun for what it is. Played it with a few graphic updates and it's funny to see that even driving a car in this game seemed easier and less annoying than it did in GTA IV (at least to my memory).

There's not much I can say here for a ""new"" view on this game, something so popular for so many years. But I think it hit some good notes to really get the Grand Theft Auto series going fully. This game is definitely more difficult than some of the later games, but in some ways it is more weirdly ""realistic"" in that sense. One simple detail is that more difficult police show up earlier here than they seem to do in later games, which would make sense if you have a maniac on the streets.

And the other aspect is the gangs themselves: once you anger one, then their territory is now more dangerous for you. I like the aspect that the gangs remember you and will attack, but I don't like the fact that just driving any car through the area instantly triggers it. If I'm in some car with tinted windows, do I really want gangs to be clairvoyant and know that it's me? Thus it's a good idea with bad execution, but that's understandable given this is an earlier game.

There is not much dialogue preventing to get introduced deeper in the characters and their dimensions. Moreover the jobs are always driving and shooting while in a VC there is much more diversity already.  The Taxi and Vigilante missions are there though and they are always fun.

GTA 3 is history, great milestone and open-world genre's godfather which always should be remembered as such.

I'm talking like, intended design (no map, no blips on radar) and overall physics and how the game caluclates things.

If you play above 30FPS, you're in for a treat; you can't reverse most cars, if you walk down a flight of stairs you're going to at least lose half of your health, if you play widescreen, your aim reticule is off.

I mean, on one hand, I still appreciate this game to this day it's old, It's still got charm - but how R* is still selling this as broken as it is, I have no idea. It's very legacy indeed and as such you need to read into it and modify stuff for at least 20 minutes if you want an optimal experience. As far as I know, there's no missions that break if you play beyond 30FPS, so the game is completable.

EDIT: Game broke at two seperate missions because the frame limiter was turned off, thanks a bunch Rockstar. So no - the game is not completable without turning it on at some points. But how is the user suppose to know when to toggle it on? I lost at least 3 hours out of my 16hrs played because of bullshit like dying because you walk down stairs and the unexpected crashes. I've listed the missions that crash below.

Mission  #1: S.A.M
Mission #2: last mission (by Catalina)

    [*]SilentPatch
    [*]Thirteennag's Widescreen fix
    [*]GInput (if you plan on using a controller)
    [*]1.1 patch (comes with Steam, not with retail versions)

By standards of today, yes, this game is dated and clunky, but I'd still consider it a must and true pleasure for any fan of the GTA series. It's one of those old style games where you still need to memorize the map. Rather than limiting, I found that this increases the immersion. On average, the missions are also harder (even if often a lot simpler) than those of the more recent GTA games.

Note that you will need to install some patches to make it work on steam, but there are plenty of guides to get you started on that. Besides the silent patch and widescreen fix (which are essential), I also highly recommend that you install some additional mods. The limit adjuster increases the view distance drastically, making it much easier to navigate around the city. I also highly recommend the skygfx mod, which adds some extra special effects, as well as the ginput mod which allows you to enjoy the game properly with a gamepad (if you have one). With CLEO, you can also install the frame limiter patch, which allows you to play the game at 60 fps without having to suffer from physics bugs. Finally, there's also a CLEO mod for allowing camera control whilst driving (as in GTA IV and upwards), although I don't recommend that when playing through the missions as I found that it breaks at least one mission.

+ Interesting story with creative missions. If you've ever played a GTA game before, you'll know what you're in for with this title: Lots of killing rival gangs, planting car bombs, blowing up stuff, robbing banks, and so on.

+ Voice-acting is solid for the most part and the graphics are alright.

+ Sizeable map with tons of areas to explore and quite a number of side missions

Cons:
- Clunky controls, ESPECIALLY in gunplay. There's some sort of widescreen bug that causes your character to not shoot acurately so you need to compensate by aiming to the lower-left of your target. Plus, a lot of the better guns lock you in position when firing, so you can't run & gun, which is pretty silly and makes you super vulnerable to enemy fire. 

- Poor vehicle handling. Driving in this game is like running on an ice rink.

- No map in an open-world game, really?

- Bland protagonist. He doesn't talk at all and has no memorable traits whatsoever. He's pretty much just the errand boy, really.

- Game crashed once while I was doing a mission.

Verdict:
Despite its numerous flaws, it's still really fun completing the various missions and exploring the relatively big map. However, keep in mind that several of its features are pretty dated, and don't hold up well by today's standards. I still can't believe you can't access the map in an open-world game.",1523800874,1524899625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Seriously, when this game came out 17 years ago, it was probably pretty revolutionary with its open world and near endless opportunities for mayhem. But that's pretty much where the fun wears off.

First and foremost, if you download this game through Steam, you'll need to download a third party patch just to be able to properly read the menus. This is absolutely unacceptable to release a game that can't even feasibly be played out of the box. 

The PC version of the game has terrible controller support, even with third party software emulating keypresses. It's so bad that I'll just tell you right now, don't even bother trying. Just use the mouse and keyboard. When you do, you'll realize that the person who set the default keyboard controls apparently never used an actual keyboard because the setup makes absolutely no sense and you will almost definitely need to reconfigure it to have anything close to a decent gameplay experience.

Let's get to the main issues that prevent me from enjoying this game. Well, GTA is a series known for allowing (and encouraging) you to engage in criminal mischief inside the virtual city that particular game takes place in. As a result, most of your time playing will be spent running away from the cops or maybe even going toe-to-toe with the police force (which is almost never a good idea in any of the games) and seeing how long you can survive. This is usually a lot of fun.

Not so much in GTA III. For one, losing your wanted level is nearly impossible once you get past 2 stars. Police will pursue you to the ends of the virtual earth and back again, and no matter which car you're driving, they will ALWAYS be able to catch up to you, and will ram your car into the next dimension until it explodes or you fly off a cliff and into the river. Attempting to drive anywhere with the cops on your tail is an exercise in extreme patience. You will be gnashing your teeth and cursing every time you try to move in a straight line only to be rear-ended by an invisible police vehicle and sent careening into a crowd of pedestrians, trying in vain to re-orient yourself toward your objective as every cop in the tri-county area charges you with the kind of fervor that is typically only witnessed by wild animals protecting their young from predators. I will say this, and I will say this with utmost confidence: it is simply NOT possible to clear your wanted level after 2 stars without picking up police bribes or using cheats. The upside to this is that when completing a mission clears your wanted level, you feel a mild sense of relief wash over you that I imagine is pretty close to what actual criminals feel when they successfully evade police in real life. Seriously, the cops in this game are BRUTAL.

The next issue I have with this game is that many of the missions simply don't tell you enough information about what you actually need to do. There is a mission later in the game where you are tasked with destroying coffee stands around Liberty City because they're actually acting as covers for drug dealers from a rival faction. Sounds simple enough, except no one tells you where these coffee stands are, much less that you actually have to traverse all three main areas of the city to find and destroy them all. And by the way, you have 8 minutes to do so. The only assistance you get here is that the targets will show up on your minimap once you get close enough, but unless you go online and find a map, you're basically driving around blind hoping that a little blue square pops up on your radar. Keep in mind this game was originally released before the internet was practically a household necessity, so I can only imagine what kind of fresh hell those poor folks had to endure back in the early 2000's.

While I was playing through the game, I never once felt any particular attachment to any of the main characters. I imagine this was different folks playing this game when it was first released, and it probably doesn't help that I was basically trying to push through the game as quickly as possible once I realized I wasn't enjoying it that much, but a lot of the story missions seem to try to force the player to make tough decisions regarding their allegiance that I just kinda of steamrolled through.

Bottom line is: GTA III has NOT aged well at all. If you're feeling nostalgic for an older GTA game, maybe try San Andreas or even Vice City.",1522023437,1527278216,False,6,1,0.526446223258972168,4,True,False,False,False,

Having dipped into [i]Grand Theft Auto V[/i], I decided to give the series a try, starting with [i]Grand Theft Auto III[/i]. You play the role of minor gangster who works for various criminal organizations, going on missions to steal and/or kill, and usually driving around the city in a stolen vehicle above the speed limit, through red lights, through pedestrians. Although the game is a bit dated in 2017, it introduced me to many innovative, calling-card features of the series. Although the crass presentation and heavy emphasis on stereotypes is not intended to be taken too seriously, I can understand why some players might be put off. For my part, I found the game entertaining and humorous (in a rated R kind of way) and even challenging at times.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Combat and movement on foot were a bit awkward in this game but also in-line with other games from the same time period. On the other hand, driving around in the city was surprisingly fluid and responsive, aside from a few glitches and camera angles. Most of the game involves undertaking tasks from various gang leaders, and these tasks frequently involve driving from one location to another or performing tasks while driving around the city: the kind of stuff you would expect a low level gangster to do on behalf of Tony Soprano (plus the token stolen vehicle). Although the missions are pretty basic on the surface, most are actually quite fun, perhaps within the greater context of the story and the setting. And quite a few missions are downright challenging, which can be an issue since there is no way to adjust difficulty.  I was able to complete all the main missions (and phone missions) in the game, albeit with some help from the internet for the more challenging ones.

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
The protagonist, Claude, is a low level gangster who is hired by a number of shady characters throughout the game to do their dirty work. If you want to get picky about his story, you argue that there does not seem be any real motivation for him to do these favors for them (except perhaps a long game of revenge), but he does them nonetheless, perhaps for the money, except he doesn't really buy anything in the game, except weapons and ammo (and new paint jobs for his vehicles). So, yes, he is pretty forgettable - I probably will not remember his name next week - but there are other characters voiced by Hollywood stars, but I would not call any of them particularly memorable either, even if you recognize the talent behind their voices. The best characters in the game - by far - are the DJs on the various radio stations that you can listen in your car. And while some of the music does get repetitive after 27 hours of play, the songs, commercials, and soundbites are surprisingly catchy and entertaining. 

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
The story is set in a fictional American city that is subdivided into three major areas connected by tunnels and bridges. The city design is phenomenal. There were times when I was hoping for a map that I could pull up beyond just the minimap, but over the course of the game you become pretty familiar with the layout. It is effectively an open-world setting. At the start of the game Claude is betrayed by his partner during a heist and is sent to prison. After he escapes, he continues his life of crime by working for various gangsters. The city, the gangsters, and the radio stations cover the whole ethnic spectrum of American society where each group is represented by its criminal stereotypes (e.g. Japanese Yakuza, Italian Mafia, Colombian Cartel, crooked cops, etc.). There really are no good guys in this game.

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
Graphics are a bit dated in [i]Grand Theft Auto III[/i], but the sound and especially the music are excellent. There were a few visual glitches here and there but no gamebreaking bugs that I recall. I did apply one of the unofficial patches through the Steam community.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] The cities of [i]Grand Theft Auto III[/i] are basically an open-world setting, and you could just go drive around, mess around, even after completing the main story. My Stats say that I only completed 42% of the content, so clearly I left a lot of optional challenges and content undone. But rather than stick around in GTA III, my plan is to move onward to Vice City. 

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 7/10

+ it was a MASSIVE revolution in the open world games back in 2001, blew everyone's minds and shaped the industry to the open world era and the ""GTA clones"".
+ First GTA ever to be fully 3D 
+ Good graphics for the time (looks dated now, but tolerable)
+ Great gameplay for the time
+ Good arcade driving physics
+ Rockstar's first try of a story for the GTA series, and even if it's not great like later games, it was a nice start, with charismatic characters and voice dialog
+ The open world, now considered tiny, felt HUGE at the time
+ Good selection of weapons
+ Opponents can be dismembered by shots, something that is only possible in this game on the GTA series so far
+ Iconic cars like the banshee, Infernus and the Stallion were born in this game
+ There is a plane on the game, named ""dodo"" (a bird that couldn't fly), and it fits the name very well, since flying this thing is a challenge on its own. It's basically a minigame.
+ Nice soundtrack (Flashback FM is the best radio station, with the whole scarface movie soundtrack)
+ huge mod community



- Missions get quite hard at the end and can be frustrating, because of the respawn system (the hardest 3d game of the series IMO)
- You can't swim
- Motorbikes, helicopters, and planes (proper planes) were not present yet
- gets stretched visuals on widescreens (To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG)
- The shotgun and M16 are very OP, and can kill you or blow up your car in a few shots (annoying on late game)
- by the end of the game, mostly everyone hates you, and cruising the map in certain areas can be very dangerous and annoying

I also recommend the ""silent patch"", by silent, that fixes many bugs of the game

I made this purchase based on nostalgia, and that's it.  I don't recommend buying it for that reason, only if you want to play the game that started it all for the GTA series.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.

It came out in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox so obviously it aged very terribly as one can easily tell from the blocky crapfest of graphics, slippery driving and terrible shooting controls, and extremely hard or super easy missions (mostly just driving and killing). There just isn't much content that you can enjoy off of and this pales in comparison to later games like Vice City and San Andreas with more content, better controls and gameplay, extensive settings and plot, and have withstood the test of time more. 

To be fair, the voice acting and execution of the cinematic cutscenes are well done and ahead of its time as you wouldn't expect such good presentation from 2001. Also, many of the issues that myself and others complain (i.e., game-breaking bugs) are only exclusive to the Steam version whereas the remastered ports for console and mobile have better visuals, controls, etc. After all, this was the first GTA game to try something different and would later be expanded and improved upon in Vice City and especially San Andreas. But hey, at least this game works after some work arounds with the files unlike the PC port of GTA IV.

I wouldn't really recommend nor not recommend this, but sadly seeing how there doesn't exist a ""neutral"" option when making these reviews, I have to recommend against this game. Just buy this game on a sale if you really want to play this game, though better to just save your money and buy the newer GTA games (except IV because of its poor optimization) instead. Or you can just buy GTA 3 on the Google Play or Apple Store which RockStar actually optimized it for more modern systems.

It doesn't exactly live up to the nostalgia obviously. You'll probably play this game for an hour or so before having an itch to play the newest GTA game. It's sad, but these games didn't really age well and a lot of the mechanics are overly punishing. Like, I don't remember this as a kid, but good luck completing most of the later missions without failing them a dozen times first. I totally forgot how unforgiving this game was.

Still fun, and usually on really deep sales, and for that reason alone I can recommend it.

I still have an audio issue I can't resolve. It's almost like when there's too many things taking up the channels the audio crackles (ie: if I have the radio on, I crash into a pole while simultaneously hitting a person, the person's scream/shout will crackle like hell.)

If you didn't play through this game previously, like in your childhood, you'll probably really not enjoy it.

Pros:
+I had to try to adapt to its graphics of old times for a few hours,then I found this game is really fun.as the gameplay itself is similar with the sequels,I think its graphics won't be a big problem if you want to play it nowadays.
If you love gta5,I think you will also love gta3 only if you can adapt to its graphics.
+Wonderful story-line with many interesting missions,some missions are a little difficult,and you can finish the mission by different ways.
+A big and well designed opening world map which depicts the whole city of Liberty City(is that city real?).
+There are many gangs in the game,such as Italian Mafia,Triad in China Town,Japanese Yakuza,Columbia,Yardie,every gang has its unique cars and outfits...So you get more enemies except cops. 
+There are many hidden contents waiting for you to explore on the map.weapons、money、hearts、stars...That's fun.
+Many kinds of weapons and cars.
+Awesome raido songs! I love the songs ""I am hot tonight"" and ""She is on fire"".

Cons:
-Can't check the map of the whole city in the game,and many important places aren't marked on the mini-map. 
-Can buy guns in the shop,but can't buy and change outfits in the game.

Pros or Cons:
+/-The protagonist Claude never said even a single word.

Arguably the most controversial game of 2001 and the first massive success in the video game industry of a post 9/11 world, GTA III is a game about revenge, murder and chaos. Set in the fictional New York-inspired Liberty City, you take control of a mute named Claude. He and his girlfriend Catalina are escaping from a bank heist when she turns on Claude, shooting him and leaving him on the ground for the police to find minutes later. A few days later while on a transfer to the city's detention centre a car intervenes with the convoy and frees the prisoners while also managing to destroy the bridge the event took place on. 

The game contains a great open world that was extremely impressive back in the year of release. It has a good story but admittedly it's not very in-depth. The soundtrack is full of fantastic songs from the main theme's relaxing piano to the various radio stations filled with a selection of liscensed and original tracks. The graphics are still pretty decent by today's standards but the character models have not aged that well. There is oodles of activities and situations to get yourself into in Liberty City.

Overal this game is a masterpiece that will keep you playing for a long time and it's something I can reccomend even to detractors of the sandbox genre.",1511874283,1511874283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

And the graphics settings are terrible. There's only draw distance, frame limiter, widescreen, and resolution. The game looks atrocious. Literal PS1 textures, what in the hell. They don't use the Xbox version's textures, and they even removed some things too!

Those reasons alone are good enough for me to say don't buy this game, emulate it for free. 

If you ever see the GTA trilogy on sale, just get San Andreas on its own. Even then, I barely recommend that awful port, bt it's not as bad as this one.

On his adventure to the city Brazzaville, of Congo. On a lone job to catch a beloved local tiger, he is caught by rights groups and is sent to prison. He is bailed out by a mysterious benefactor known only as ""Jade"". She strikes a deal. If he catches 2 female tigers and a rare male albino, his debt is considered repayed. The first poach goes smoothly but he miscalculates the sedative. The tiger escapes his van and runs through the city until it is captured by a woman in a green dress. The benefactor tells him the catch was close enough and the tiger is now in her custody. The next poach starts with a rival gang, the Wet Vipers, in the downtown area sabotaging his gear. After all his gear is defected, Angus is forced to kill the co-leader of the Wet Vipers using only a sharpened ivory toy and then abduct the tiger barehanded. Suspecting trouble, Jade sends the girl in the green dress once again. This time they take down the tiger together and she kisses Angus before flying away with the tiger in a helicopter. Angus demands answers from Jade. She declines but the assistant calls his cell phone anyway. They arrange a date. She discloses her name: Angel. She knows about his debt and would like to help him capture the albino which is now in captivity. They go back to Angus' apartment, filled with supplies and they have sex after planning the next job. The next morning they both gear up and head to the enclosure housing the albino tiger. An elaborate plan to sneak in as a animal caretaker and a vet goes as planned until the Wet Viper leader arrives posing as another vet. A shootout in the tiger enclosure leads to Angel shot in the arm and the Wet Viper leader dead. Viper goons begin entering the captivity and forcing staff out at gunpoint. Angel asks him to take the albino tiger and leave her. He declines, stating that he is in love with her. He picks her up and shoots his way out the back entrance. In a wild car chase they lose the Vipers and police. Angus takes his new love to the hospital where she recovers fully in 4 days. When she is able to leave, Angus admits they cannot be together because he did not capture the 3rd tiger and thus cannot pay his debt to Jade. He walks away and returns home, quickly packing to flee the country. When he arrives to his most recent stolen car, Angel is sitting in the passenger seat. He tells her let him go. She grabs him and kisses him, revealing that she is Jade and that the debt is repayed because he saved her. They flee to Nigeria and start a new life.

+ Pretty easy to mod
+ Dismemberment System from Soldier of Fortune due to the usage of the GHOUL engine
+ Mostly great voice acting
+ Great cutscenes
+ Some really well made missions

- Not a port of the Xbox version which had actual shaders and a bunch of other improvements
- Pretty bad PC port (Easy to fix that with mods though)
- The lack of an actual Map is incredibly annoying, I'd rather have no minimap and a real map.
- Some missions don't show you the actual objective and you have to find it yourself (which becomes quite tedious without an actual map
- Some missions are unneccesary difficult due to rètarded A.I or just feel not that well thought out in general 
- Every radio station only has 5 songs and about 3 voice lines, the Radio stations also all have atrocious sound quality 
- The cutscenes before missions are incredibly brief and characters mostly say in 2 words what you need to do, the lack of exposition hurts the already bad story even more.
- Claude's motivations aren't really comprehensible, he doesn't act the same way consistently [spoiler] Claude is a cold hearted killer the whole game and doesn't care about anything but money but in the end he suddenly cares for a woman that he never showed any emotions for and starts collecting money to ransom her out? [/spoiler]  ( a problem later GTA games also have) 
- The game in general feels quite unfinished, when flying over Skyscrapers you will notice that many of them don't have an actual roof and the ones that do mostly only have a cosmetic roof you can't stand on because it has no collision, scattered over the entire map there are white lines visible where two parts of the map come together, the game always hardcrashes at certain locations (Leone's house after [spoiler] he dies [/spoiler]) which makes a certain mission unbeatable unless you cheat.
- The lack of the ability to swim isn't a problem in VC due to water only being between the two cities but here it is because Liberty City has quite a lot of rivers that you can accidentally fall (or drive) into and while I almost never died to water in VC I died to water in GTA 3 quite often. Also since there's no option to jump out of a moving car, you can't escape in the last moment like you can in VC.
- It's pretty short and the story is just good enough to not be atrocious.
- Absolutely no memorable characters

Overall this game was a good entry into the 3D universe but it's not necessarily worth playing even if you're a GTA fan. It was probably a 9/10 back in 2001 but gets dragged down by parts incredibly awful mission design and definitely didn't age as well as San Andreas or even Vice City.

However


if you intend on playing this game with a controller, you are better off playing one of the console versions. Like, say, the Playstation Two version, for example. I tried playing it with my wired Xbox 360 controller and let me tell you, the controller support for this game sucks. You can't control the camera and barely any of the buttons work. Not to mention the controller menu doesn't do a good job of listing anything. Everything goes by numbers and shit. Now I know what you're thinking ""Well this game is really old. Of course it would go by what those controllers had back than"" and let me say Postal Two is just as old and it does a good job of showng what does what. X button is X button. Left Trigger is Left Trigger. All it would take is a small update and badda bing-badda boom, you can tell what does what.



In general, if you are nostalgic and want a trip to the past, buy it. But if you intend on playing with a controller, look elsewhere.",1499253826,1499253826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Grand Theft Auto III changed gaming for the best! This game took elements from the first four games and expanded further from 2D to 3D, and from Arcade to an Open World. This game is amazing! The story is really great, the missions were awesome, the characters have great personlities, and the best part about this game is that you can freely do whatever you want. Kinda like the last few entries.

I would highly recommened this game to anyone who has never played a GTA game. The game is dated, but there's a lot of replayability with it! A ture classic of the series! I wonder if Take Two ever plan a remake of this game. If that happens, I'll flip!

The only problem I have with this game are the controls though. Using a Dualshock 4 works but the only problem is that there's no option for you to control the camera on the remote. The only way to control it is the mouse and I find it very uncomfortable to use the DS4's touchpad to control the camera, so I wouldn't reconmmend using it.

It's hilarious how most, if not all, of the other recent reviews are people downvoting the game because of Rockstar's decision to remove OpenIV.

But I think they should've complained on GTA V and IV, because they're isn't really any unbiased recent reviews. But here's one.

So basically, after a cutscene, you are placed straight into a mission. The game gives you a little tutorial before getting you to drive to a certain location. The graphics are good for 2002, the sound is good, never heard of any of the songs, but I don't like the lack of waypoints, as I have no idea where I am going, and how easy the cars are to damage, and flip. I ran over someone and even the ambulance that arrived was beat up.

But the game is really a 20-30 hour experience as is. 

With modding, the game has an unbelievable extended life that console platform players wish they could achieve on the PC.

I love R* and all the Grand Theft Auto family of games, but lets be real here. R* banned all modding recently in their nuclear management decision to curb cheating in their more modern GTA franchise starting with OpenIV. With OpenIV, modders and the Grand Theft Auto Community, you have a game that can be played for years in SP mode for GTA4 and 5.

When Take Two (publisher) decides to monetize on that goodwill withOUT creating any additional content or assets for the SP user base, trying to force those user online and destory it at the same time, I cannot recommend ANYONE to put their hard earn money into buying ANY Take Two Published games.

It is exactly like a politician taking away your RIGHTS - RIGHTS mean something that you have with no questions asked - since modding and OpenIV does not HARM the purchaser, publisher or online experience whatsoever. The mods ONLY work in single player. It is absolutely one of the main reason gamers even buy GTA in the first place.

Again for the reading impared, OpenIV CANNOT and does NOT allow any of its modded contented to be used online or interact with that post apocalyptic Detroit where no Robocop can be found they call GTAO. 

Before anyone disputes this, lookup what OpenIV actually DOES, and note there are CONSUMER FAIR USE LAWS in most IP protected countries that allows private modding for personal use. 

So NO, I do not recommend anyone to buy ANY Take Two published games including GTA series from R* until they change their shill corporate policy towards the community that built them in the first place.

If I can I would REFUND all my Take Two published games and delete it off my HD right away.",1497874022,1498281929,False,2,0,0.425988823175430298,0,True,False,False,False,

Money is pretty much not a problem at all as missions very quickly give larger amounts of money, but the mini map doesn't tell you where the ammunation stores are at, so you'll have to remember where they are if you have to pick up weapons for a mission that requires you to enter a gunfight.

You may often find yourself wanting to quit and reload the game in order to keep your weapons, rather than continuing after a death, because as stated earlier, ammunations are hidden from your mini map.

Future games in the series have less and less of these issues stated, but with nothing to reference back during III's initial release, this game was better received back then than if it were to be re-evaluated by today's standards.",1495537340,1495537340,False,2,0,0.459596782922744751,6,True,False,False,False,

After 20 hours of play time (story completion plus a few bits ‘n’ bobs), running on Windows 7, an AMD graphics card and a Dual Shock 3 control pad, I experienced no glitches or game breaking difficulties. Furthermore, after adding in a couple of mods (a controller mod and silentpatch), controls were no problem at all, effectively restoring the game to its original state. Textures and colour were all as expected with no unexpected glitches or rendering errors with the game or menus, and once the resolution was adjusted in the game options GTA 3 worked fully.  There are many more mods available to enhance the PC experience, some more recommended than others, but with a couple of minor tweaks GTA 3 was 100% playable. However, Grand Theft Auto 3 is 15 years old, the series’ first foray into 3D and it really shows.

GTA3 tells the story of silent protagonist Claude, who is betrayed whilst attempting a bank raid and subsequently arrested. With things looking grim for him, a stroke of luck sees his prison transport attacked by a Columbian cartel, and Claude makes a hasty escape onto the streets of Liberty City. And so begins Claude’s ascent through the various criminal elements whilst he seeks revenge against his double crossing partner. In its purest form GTA 3 is a crime sandbox with variations upon the now established chase/destroy/escape/escort mission format. This being Rockstar’s jump into 3D many of the modern conventions are missing or present in an incredibly crude form. Whilst Liberty City is an impressive construct for a game of this pedigree, exploration is strictly limited to outdoors, with entry to buildings something that would follow only in later entries to the series. Graphically what was once a marvel to behold clearly shows it’s age, but going in with few expectations they are more than serviceable and do not impact upon enjoyment of exploration.

What is infuriating is the incredibly limited mapping system present in the game. Landmark Icons are all but absent, with markers arbitrarily disappearing as the story is completed, and with no in-game map available (a mod is available to correct this) sometimes navigating through the city, especially in time limited missions can be incredibly frustrating. Whilst vehicle physics are dated, and at times almost comic book in their over action, once accustomed to the at times ‘floaty’ handling driving around the city is mostly pain free with around 50 different cars available. Piloting the boats is somewhat less satisfying (although there are very few missions that require this), and the only available plane, the Dodo, is nigh on impossible to use effectively. Furthermore, swimming is not yet possible and Claude is unable to make a hasty escape from damaged cars, requiring them to be virtually stationary to allow egress. Radio stations, whilst somewhat less stunning than in the newer games, breathe character into the city’s population, and giving the player such an easy way to manipulate their in-game soundtrack was a masterstroke, although not yet the finely polished feature that it would become.

Perhaps the most frustrating thing for a modern gamer is the targeting system utilised for armed combat. With no player controlled camera, and only a rudimentary lock-on system, combat becomes more luck than skill, with hasty target shuffling in vain attempts to knock out as many threats as quickly as possible. Whilst later GTA games have become known for their storytelling, here, with a silent lead, it can be difficult to adequately track the what’s and why’s of what’s going on. The plot is shallow and barely satisfying, but nevertheless is adequate in dovetailing one mission to the next. Given the mission structure, progress is often incredibly frustrating, with large elements of trial and error. The difficulty is pitched at a relatively fair level, with few missions acting as a barrier for very long, although the occasional timed objective, in conjunction with the absence of map can be soul destroying for its duration.

It’s a shame that Steam has no neutral rating because that’s firmly where I feel GTA 3 belongs. As a snapshot in time it’s an experience worth having, but as a game that’s worth committing time to it has long been surpassed by its successors. Personally I don’t regret seeing the roots of 3D GTA, but unless you have a similar desire I’d recommend that you skip forward to Vice City, or better yet where the series really came together, San Andreas.",1494411218,1494411242,False,4,0,0.453312605619430542,3,True,False,False,False,

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

1)Spectacular graphics
2)Interesting plot
3)(Some)funny missions
4)Italian dubbing (for mafia)
5)(Some)Pleasurable radio stations

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

1)(Some)Boring missions
2)Inefficient map
3)(Partially)Stupid Artificial Intelligence

[b]Pros explanation:[/b]

1)[i]Considering the release date, I think it's safe to say that the graphics is undoubtely on a high - very high level.[/i]

2)[i]On the overall the plot is interesting and captivating. Yeah, there are some boring missions, but almost all of them aren't plot related and are not a must-do, so you can skip them if you want.[/i]

3)[i]On the other side, there are some missions that are indeed very very funny.[/i]

4)[i]This was a tidbit. I am italian and as soon as I heard the sicilian dialect from the mafia characters I ended up being pleasurably surprised. These are, in my personal opinion, the details that allow a game to be on a higher level than the other ones.[/i]

5)[i]This is about personal taste but I can definitely say that there's basically a radio station for all the tastes and, of course, I found the ones I personally like.[/i]

[b]Cons explanation:[/b]

1)[i]See point 2 on ""pros explanation"" section about the missions.[/i]

2)[i]The map has been probably the most annoying thing of all the game, because on the GPS the only shown icons were the safe house and the mission symbols (no hospital / weapons shop / car repainting location). There isn't even a key that allows you to see the whole map from the game and this ""forced"" me to download from the internet and print it.[/i]

3)[i]The artificial intelligence on the overall works properly, but for some reason the enemies (only mission related) do not shot you unless you are very very close or you shoot them (and sometimes even if you do it, they keep standing still). Also they act strangely even in close fights (howewer this happened only in one mission). [/i]

[b]Final considerations:[/b]

[i]On the overall I definitely suggest this game to anyone who likes the genre. The flaws are definitely unimportant and pass almost unnoticed during the playing sessions, making the experience fun and captivating.[/i]

Now, not so much.  Many cars have high centers of gravity such that they easily roll over when making turns, the surfaces result in your car crashing from the slightest of bumps, and cars are very fragile such that they blow up relatively easily not to mention they catch on fire and explode if they're rolled over which can kill you very easily, especially if a gang is shooting you and the police decide to shoot at you because you ran over a gang member. 

The compass doesn't show points of interest outside of mission origins such that you have to pause the game and refer to an online map to catch your bearings if you want to find health, armor, gun shops, pay and sprays, or safehouses.  The targeting system the PS2 version came with is broken since you either use standard controls which don't target or classic controls which do but don't allow your mouse to freely aim.  A lot of the missions are ridiculous as well in that they're timed while you have to weave through congested traffic and the computer gets insane handling.  

Lastly, many players complain of launching bugs.  I had a few myself, but thankfully got around them.  The menu button labels start transparent and gradually fade into appearance.  The game itself will freeze you computer in the intro screens unless you launch in compatibility mode as an administrator.  The game also defaults to poor resolutions that many players are unable to play without.

ESRB came into every single home like a plaque, then rockstar took on the media with two of the most controversial video games to this day, that was manhunt and Grand theft auto three. 

GTA 3 is based on the work of R* and turned heads in so many crowds, it had such success that the media tried shutting down violence in the video game industry, unfortunetly Rockstar made one of the most successful games that forged a generation of veteran gamers, GTA 3 hold's a special place in my memories, where you can hijack the banshee from across 8 Ball's garage, put a series of gamebreaking cheats to turn this sandbox into the most exciting game for it's time.

the GTA veterans will appreciate the trilogy over the recent installment of GTAV which was also a outstanding piece of work by R* games.

I played this game mostly on the phone and later decided to buy it on pc. There are a few differences that I noticed while playing the steam version like:

The car textures are all dark. Yeah it's not a big problem, but it could be annoying.
There are a few glitches that I encountered, pretty big ones like cars being stuck in air and cars being stuck in buildings. There were a few crashes when I tried to skip the intro sequence but that's about it. Keep in mind that gta 3 is an older game so you will probably encounter something like that  if you are playing the game the on a modern system.

Now about the game itself.  Gta 3 is an open world action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games. And the question is it is worth playing it ? The answer is yes. Every gta game should be worth playing even though you got gta 5 and 4 this stills holds up well in my opinion. The characters, the atmosphere and the city itself is memorable. But those things could be the only good things about the game. Because it doesn't have much to offer nowadays. You can't customize your character, there's not lot of weapons and you can't even swim ! The funny thing is you will receive a lot of money. Already for the first mission in the game you will get 1500. But you really can't spend money on a lot of stuff. But something about the game to me is just magical and I don't know what it is. You will probably hate this game if you have already played more advance gta games. The game does get difficult especially in the end but you once played that mission enough times you will get good at it. But it's not the mission that are difficult. It's the side mission and collectibles that are required for 100% completion in the game if you are the guy who wants to get everything out of the game. Exploring is fun even though you can't do much in the city it's still fun to find a weapon or a collectible of which there are total of 100 hidden collectibles in the whole city ! 

So that's about it. Hopefully this review helped you a bit to me this game is definitely one of my favourite games and hopefully you will give this game chance !",1491318900,1491318900,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,

Around 1999, shortly after the release of the top-down GTA 2, Rockstar decided to cash into the trend of 3D gaming, and started development of GTA 3. What was once a cheesy, cartooney 3D city evolved into the living monolith the 3D Rendition of Liberty Ciy was. Taking place in 2001, while robbing a bank, an unnamed thug (known as Fido in game) is fatally shot by his girlfriend, Catalina. This man goes through various friends, enemies and betrayals to get to his goal of killing his girlfriend at a dam in a dramatic final mission. Liberty City is a giant. Consisting of three large islands and a huge green inaccessable countryside, Liberty City is stunning visually. The game has a decent array of weapons, with some of these weapons being an overpowered shotgun and Carbine Rifle, a sniper rifle, an undersized AK-47 and a well rounded Micro Uzi. With these weapons come mechanics. Though GTA 3 has generally solid mechanics, it does have setbacks, like inaccurate auto targeting (Classic Control Method) and the inability to crouch. Driving mechanics are quite good, with a big heavy army truck being hard to spin out following a fender crash, and a Viper based sports car spinning two 360s as the result of such collision. GTA 3's radio selection, while not nearly as good as the one in Vice City, is still decent. I was often listening to Head Radio, Double Clef, K-Jah or Flashback FM. If you loathe the entire game's soundtrack, this PC version supports custom radio stations, which can be accomplished by dragging your mp3s in the folder of the same name in the game directory. Additional PC features include choosable skins for the player, and full aiming with any weapon, something the PS2 version of the game did not support. There is alot more content and easter eggs in this amazing game that will keep you busy. Though you will find more fun in Vice City, that is not putting down GTA 3 at all. Even if you do get bored of the main game, the PC versions of both games support major mods, like the RealGTA mod for GTA III.

I remember staying up late at night playing this on a rented PS2. It changed the world of gaming forever with its approach. The world is big (not as big as new GTA versions but it was at the time), the options are seamingly endless, the sand in the sandbox is deep (again not as much as new GTA games but was very much so for the time).

The fact that the character you play speaks no words is in itself, a very interesting dynamic to the game. It makes you more aware of the other characters, the missions, the world; everything is embellished with great detail because of your silence. You carry out bloodthirsty murders, arsons, and robberies with cold indifference to your actions. It's kind of chilling to think about.

The violence of the game was disturbing to lots of people and it is pretty bloody. The concept of a free-range murderer is kind of frightening, but the game is very much a game so there is nothing to worry about. Have fun blowing cars up. It's just a game.

The story is very obviously borrowed from gangster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas and such. This is a bonus though, as everything seems very familiar to you, like you are already a made man.

Excellent game, and playable all the way through.

Grand Theft Auto III was the first game ever to start what has culminated today in one of the greatest games known in videogaming. Being the first open world game to feature polygonal tridimensional models, it started a trend that would continue to evolve until this very day. Rockstar Games is known to many as a Publisher that invests everything in their games because they want to excel in what they do and they want to deliver to the public. With GTA III it is shown how that set of mind started and how each Publisher and/or Developer should treat their IPs. 

GTA III has a fun story plagued with satiric comments to Pop Stars and the way of life of the era it is situated in, in this case the 2000's. If you've not played this game at all, I won't spoil the story, but damn it's 2017! You better start playing it! 

While right now GTA V surpasses in every way the now outdated GTA III, it still is a fun game to play to reminisce about how it all started, and let's be honest, doesn't matter how polygonal the city or characters are, it's always fun to smash your car against other cars and shoot everything that moves, because GTA is mayhem and that's why you are going to buy this game! 

So, ready to go back to Liberty City my friend?

It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it. 

The core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.

GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it. 

This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started.

The story missions take you on an interesting journey, working your way up the mafia ladder (for starters).

The downsides are the lighting seems way too dark on most models. Also, lighting normals seem to be non-existant. This seems to be a thing for this era of game. I don't know whether it is that normals are broken, or they just are not there.

On top of being a footnote in gaming history for its stylish, gritty comic book world, you're always being challenged with a wide array of missions that sprouts lots of variety on your way to the top of the criminal hiarchy. In addition to the missions, there's also great incentive to explore every nook and cranny of Liberty City; it's blooming with tons of secret collectables and missions for you to discover where you'd least expect them !

All said and done, while some fans consider the sequels to be more polished games, there's no denying that GTA3 wrote the book on how open world games should be made. Liberty City may not be quite as big as other landmarks this day and age, but it's ALWAYS alive, there's never a moment when there's nothing happening, and that's very important to take into consideration when you're designing an open world. Nobody wants massive enviornments with nothing to do in it.

[list]
[*]	I have always enjoyed the concept of grand theft auto; driving around exploring the city, doing sub-missions, and doing main missions whenever you want to.
[*]	Some unforgettable missions.   
[*]	A story of revenge and making name for yourself, still worth playing for that.  
[*]	Top-notch voice acting and cut-scenes.
[*]	DISMEMBERMENT! You name it legs, arms and heads go flying. 

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	Nothing really to spend your money on; except for weapons and there aren't that many weapons. There's no condos, no businesses and you can't change clothes. It's kind of pointless doing the sub-missions because you are mostly getting money from them and there's nothing to spend the money on and you get plenty of money from the main missions. There's no increase in health or armour, you can't become fireproof, and the taxi missions just get boring after a while, although I still recommend you do the import/export sub-mission.   
[*]	Every gang in the city is trying to kill you. Nearly every street you drive down, there's always someone shooting at you, no rest for the wicked. 
[*]	It's hard to see the details on the car because all the cars have a dark metallic colour.  
[*]	Protagonist isn't voice acted.
[*]	All of the missions take place outside; there are no missions which involve going inside. The only two places in the game were you can go inside of are Ammu-nation and your safe house garage.
[*]	The radio stations were meh. Flashback FM was probably my favourite.   
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u]    

Still worth playing for the main missions; like I said top-notch voice acting and cut -scenes. A bit plain, but it was the first full 3d GTA; no more bird's eye view.

Don't Bother with this one. Beyond it being the first fully 3D Grand Theft Auto game, and one of the first games to do 3D open worlds well (being a massive improvement over Driver and Driver 2 before it), there's very little here that was not either also done or done better in GTA Vice City and/or San Andreas. Beyond the main story (and the payphone side missions), the only things left to do is collect hidden packages, cause general mayhem and do the police, firefighter, and taxi side missions.

Contrast this with GTA Vice city where you have all of that with better and more weapons, better and more cars, better gang distribution (seriously, after a certain point in GTA 3’s story, one area of the map becomes impossible to drive through without a tank, as gang members who wield shotguns in that area will shoot at you and will blow up your car immediately upon entering their territory), better and less linear [spoiler]after killing Diaz[/spoiler] story line missions, MUCH better music (Beyond the station with the Scarface OST and the Rap Station I distinctly remember the music in GTA 3 being pretty awful) and a more interesting city with better aesthetics. All of this remains true for San Andreas, which managed to improve it beyond what even Vice City improved upon, making it that much more significantly better than GTA 3. For the most part, the liberty city of GTA 3 was depressing to look at, with a lot of grey in the colour palette, whereas for both of its successors, this was significantly improved. What I will say in GTA 3's favour is that its simplicity makes it good for a mobile game, compared with the more complex controls of Vice City and (especially) San Andreas.

Overall, don't buy this, at least not on PC, and instead buy GTA San Andreas or Vice City. Unless you're replaying it for nostalgia purposes or on your phone/tablet, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in other 3D open world games since.

Even though it has been 15 years (as of now that I'm writing this) since it's inception, to me, it's still fun as hell to play through. It may seem basic compared to the other games in the series that came after it, but Liberty City is still fun to explore, whether it may be finding the Hidden Packages, Rampages or the Easter Eggs, it's fun.

Above all, there are two standards I hold true for anime. There are anime that simply entertain for the sake of enjoyment, and there are anime that stretches the boundary of human imagination. Serial Experiments Lain falls in the latter category and for this reason Serial Experiments Lain stands out as a true classic. Serial Experiments Lain pushes the envelope of what the perceived notion of what can be done with television as a medium. The show doesn’t just provide entertainment; it provides insight, and profound views and beliefs about technology and the role it plays in society. With that said it's time to get on with the review.

Story: Given that Lain’s story progression is very disjointed, if the execution were to be even off by the slightest, the show would have been ridden with plot holes. Lain however doesn’t need worry about plot and story in the same sense as other anime, but instead relies on the atmosphere and the characters to tell the story. What little plot Lain does have, the show works with it fabulously. Now some may argue that Lain is completely plot driven, but to each his own. Personally I believe that Lain strays as far as it can from bland episodic story telling, and in essence is similar to Citizen Kane in the aspect that the story has little to do with the show. Lain above all is a character study, and the plot only moves forward under the characters.

Art: Despite the art being off center in terms of traditional anime, it hardly deters from the overall enjoyment of the series. It is important to note that the series actually benefits from the unique art style presented in Lain. Art is not a big pulling factor for Lain, so if you are a fan of high quality art, you may be in for a rough ride.

Sound: The series relies on a minimalist approach to sound and music. Dialogue is sparse, but very profound. Sound effects are seldom used but with brevity, and has a lasting impact on the viewer. Once again, this lack of a quality that would normally be detrimental to an anime’s enjoyment, but becomes one of Lain’s strengths. The sound of the electricity running through power lines, the empty sound of Lain typing on her keyboard, and the scarce use of music. These are all memorable pieces of sound effects that adds to the overall impact of the show.

Character: Now this is where Lain shines brightest. In a vast wasteland of mundane same-old, Lain sticks out as an anime that takes its characters to a level that most anime can only dream of achieving. The character of Lain is perhaps the most deep and relevant characters in anime today. To explain upon this point, one would have to watch the series and comprehend the various themes and motif’s on one’s own. But in order to be brief, Lain’s character can be summarized as ascending from human status, to near God like power through the prowess of the internet. Ahem, I mean, “The Wired.” It’s a simple concept and seems like it has been done before, giving credit to the argument, and it probably has. But the beauty here is the cast of side characters that surround Lain. Her sister, her father, mother, and friends, are all extremely deep characters, that although don’t appear to be, are actually extremely poignant in their own right.

Enjoyment & Closing: If watched with an open mind, Lain will do more than simply entertain. It is truly revolutionary anime for its time, and the amount of depth in the show is utterly staggering. Never in my years of watching anime have I seen a show as thought provoking as Lain. If one were so inclined to contact me, we could talk for hours upon hours of the religious symbols, and religious references that run about the shows course. We could then change the subject to comparing Lain’s character to that of philosophy of the Jungian Shadow. We could converse and discover deeper and more universal meanings as time progressed. Lain is such a show that the viewer doesn’t just watch it. The viewer must be pushed to think, and who doesn’t want to do a bit a of thinking once in a while?",1480190723,1480190723,True,1,1,0.502824842929840088,0,True,False,False,False,

This game had mediocre graphics, iffy physics, uninspired storyline and it ran badly even on some powerful PCs. It was undeniably rushed, with a plethora of bugs popping up left and right. They didn't even bother to put a roof on most of the buildings, assuming no one will see it (they were wrong)... These are actual complaints frequently repeated back in the day.

And yet, this game has redefined the term ""sandbox"" into what we know it as today. It didn't excel at any aspect... but it just made a darn good use of all what it had. It really felt like the most complete and realistic simulation of a gangster yet. Wreaking havoc has never been so satisfying before.

At the time, the possibilities appeared endless. The city seemed huge beyond imagination, I could spend hours just driving around listening to the radio. There's nothing you couldn't do - you could have multiple apartments, save cars in a garage, fly a plane, drive a boat, annihilate surroundings with a tank, work as a cab driver, paramedic, firefighter or even a cop (!). Not to mention the map was filled up to the brim with collectibles and other minor secrets.

Many people despised the dull and grim looks of the Liberty City. To me, it is fitting. Unlike many of the sequels, in this entry the city is dark and often shrouded in fog. This really makes for an distinctive atmosphere.

Even though the graphics as a whole failed to impress, there were so many little quirks it really caught your attention. You could rip out car panels. Doors could open on impact (which would then flap around as you drove in the corners), and the protagonist would attempt to close them. Cars could spawn in several variants, for example as a cabriolet or hardtop. You could dismember pedestrians - a feature that was removed from the subsequent games. There were leaves and old newspapers floating around. Rockstar has also implemented a day and night cycle and various weather conditions, making the virtual world ever so immersive.

The soundtrack is superb, it's definitely one of the things that made GTAIII so special. I love the fact that the radio stations were composed mostly from music produced specifically for this game. It's really a shame that Rockstar has dropped this approach in the newer games (aside from Liberty City Stories, which also featured a truly unique and memorable soundtrack).

As with any GTA, this game doesn't take itself very seriously. The humour is spot on. I especially love the chat radio stations, they always end up talking about such nonsense crap it keeps me in stitches.

If I had to pick one thing about this game that has aged the worst, it'd definitely be the plot and missions. The main storyline is just a typical ""betrayed man who seeks revenge"" scenario with little to no unexpected plottwists. The missions mostly revolve around transporting the item/person, collecting items, killing someone, driving from point A to point B... This was perfectly acceptable at the time, but now it feels barren. Even the big finale doesn't really stand out from the rest.
Also, the main protagonist is completely silent. While I like that it makes him much more intriguing and mysterious (and some say this makes him easier to relate to), I really do feel like this was a wasted opportunity. Take a look at the sequels - characters like Tommy Vercetti, Carl Johnson, etc. are unforgettable. Claude just isn't.

Any way you look at it, it's a classic, a truly groundbreaking title. For me, this is by far the most nostalgic entry in the series. No other game made a bigger impression on me and none ever will. To be honest though, Vice City improved on pretty much every aspect and if you've never played III before, I doubt you'd enjoy it today. But if you can stomach it not being as good as Vice City, it's definitely recommended.",1479984922,1480148927,True,14,0,0.69641268253326416,2,True,False,False,False,

There is a mod out there to fix this and unfortunately it didnt work for me but hopefully you will have more luck if you try it. Im new to mods and pc gaming really so thats probably why.

The other issue I had was when i first loaded the game up the menus wouldnt load which makes the game unplayable unless fixed unless you can use the force to see which menu icon you are hovering over. There is also a mod out there to fix this which thankfully did work for me lol.

Apart from that its the game I remember playing as a child instead of doing homework. The fact the textures etc are updated doesnt bother me. It doesnt effect the fun you can having playing the game. It's another sweet slice of nostalgia pie.

Silent protagonist with a nice main story (personally took me roughly 10 hours and counts as about 40-45% total completion), and pleasant driving, all mixed together giving a very solid game.

[-]:
Aiming with a weapon is not smooth and shooting takes a bit of a practice to get used to. Minor bugs but nothing game breaking.

Some missions might be frustrating, especially the time-restricted ones, but once you get past them you forget them quickly enough but not enough to want to do the main story again so soon. Nothing much to do in the game after main storyline is over, some side missions can keep you busy for only a set amount of time and one simply cannot enjoy causing as much mayhem in gta3 as in gta4 or gta5, mostly because the protagonist has to stop every time to fire a weapon, but it is still fun to a certain degree.

Some hidden features like taking the train and subway to get around can only be discovered by mistake or actually reading the game manual.

[...]:
Overall, this is a great game for its time and still totally worth someone's time. And there's just something painful but satisfying about not having a full map which forces you to learn the roads and how to get around. That being said the map is not that big.

Oh and before I forget, you get shot on most of the map by the other gangs the more you do the main missions, making it difficult to move around freely later in the game, and absolutely impossible to stop and admire the scenery or do side missions in a gang zone at the end of the game.

[Performance]:
Works great on a Windows 10 Laptop having an Intel Z3735F with Intel HD Graphics(Bay Trail) on maximum settings(~40fps on average) at 1366x768.

The first thing that I noticed is that the navigational resources that we have avaiable nowadays can really make everything much easier.

The story is quite simple: You start from the bottom and every mission you complete makes you climb another step of the ladder, allowing you to meet some people with influence, unlocking stuff etc. There're some radio stations available but the songs get old really quick, trust me. Besides, there're some missions where you need to race against the clock that are simply unforgiving.

However as someone who hasen't played this game way back when, it's still really good. 

The Silent Patch for GTA III is needed to run on windows 10 to prevent alot of crashing, it also fixes many bugs and includes features originally not in the PC version. Native Widescreen support is poor, and skews your crosshair, but the widesreen patch fixes these issues. Remember to leave the frame limiter ON, it caps your game at 30 fps but its needed to not break the physics and prevent other bugs. Disable Trails if the ""motionblur"" is too much for you as well. 

The combat system is alright, armor, cover, and shooting first is a MUST to win firefights as the game gets pretty difficult, especially if you screw up. Remember to save often as well. However it's the atmosphere that really caputred me, from the inhouse-music on the radio stations taht are surprisingly good, to driving around Liberty City, getting shot at by gangs that have a pricetag on your head. Its a city torn apart by crime(one mission has the city in a blown-out turf war by two gangs), but that won't stop you from getting revenge.

The story isn't as complex and well thoughtout as other games, but  the setup is really awesome, and there are great moments through out the story. 

You are a criminal named Claude (last name may or may not be Speed) who was just betrayed by your girlfriend, and left for dead during a bank robbery. When you were being transferd to prison, the prison van was intervented by the Columbian Cartel, who then blew up the bridge you were on after kidnapping a certain inmate who is important later in the story. There were only two survivors of the explosion, you and a fellow inmate nicknamed 8-Ball. You become hired muscle for almost all the gangs in Liberty City, you rob, kill, and run what were supposed to be simple errands gone horribly, horribly wrong to get revenge on your ex. The story is surpisingly intresting if not more basic than say GTA IV or V.

Definatly worth a sale purchese, if not the full $10

The game has aged well and it still maintains its rating (9/10) but don't expect more than it has to offer. Dumb AI, no DLC, and a very light-story but it has a ton of content that will make you play at least 40-50 hours.

I played it with the Steam Controller and it was fun. I had to configure both the controllers on the Game Settings as well as the Steam Controller settings but the time invested was worth it.

This game is seperate in both story wise and game play to the first two games. Even if you never played the first two games, you will still be able to play this game as its intended as the start of its own series. With that said, now to talk about the plot, the game opens up in Liberty City, the arm pit of all the shady cities in the world. The city is a cross between New York & Pittsburg. One day a silent robber named Claude attempts a bank heist with his girlfriend named Catalina. They were about to make a run for it, however Catalina betrays Claude and leaves him for dead for the cops. Some time later, Claude is en route to prison, only for the police van to be demobilzed by the demolishing of a blown up bridge. The man responsible for blowing up the bridge is 8-Ball a trusted crime partner of Claude. 8-Ball helps Claude in a getaway vehicle and heads straight to the nearest safe house. With new clothes and new weapons, Claude is ready to get revenge on the woman who stabbed him in the back. He knows she's some where in Liberty City and the only way to hunt her down is by taking up odd jobs from various people to accomplish his quest. Made by Rockstar Games the makers of the Bully game. Grand Theft Auto 3 was the pioneer in open world environment games back when roaming in open space levels was a novelty for its time. Tons of games since then have mimic this concept including the Saints Row games which took inspiration from this franchise. Because this was an early 2000's game, expect the graphics to be a little polygonic and occasional glitches to be spotted. The concept of choosing which ever missions and exploring to collect items was something that facinated gamers at the time this game was released. The use of changing weather and cars containing hours of radio show dialoge and copyrighted music gave this game an atmosphere to it. Most of the voice actors are prolific screen actors instead of casting just voice over actors. The cast consists of Frank Vincent(Goodfellas & Raging Bull), Joe Pantoliano(Memento, Matrix, & Empire of the Sun), & Kyle MacLachlan(Twin Peaks, Dune, & Blue Velvet) just to name a few. The first two games utilized the top perspective camera mode. In this game its a third person perspective to put the gamers into the the enviroment better. As the game progresses, you will find additional items and weapons to help you out in various missions. The missions have certain rules when activated, but there are plenty of options in how to succeed depending on the situation. With the abundence of pros comes and abundence of cons. The healing items are only collected in certain areas which prooves a problem when shooting down enemies and loosing health at the same time. The fighting mechanics are a little off and its not a recommended approach when fighting enemies with guns and bats. Using guns works best for almost all situations. While you do gain the ability to store more weapons at safe houses, however vehicles are limited to only one car being stored in a garage. And because certain cars can be easily damage, get use to escaping burning vehicles and stealing new cars for replacements. And lastly on the cons is the map, the map system does high light missions, safe houses, and shops but you don't have the option to look at the whole map or place any trackers to get to certain locations. Unless you spend time memorizing the layout of the land, you might find yourself lost when trying to do vehicle based missions. With those flaws aside, this game proved to be fun to play. Challenging at times, but a very rewarding experience when achieveing the missions. Grand Theft Auto 3 helped paved way for later installments of the franchise utilizing the same concept and game play as this title. The game was even inducted into the Museum of Play's ""Video Game Hall of Fame"" which is a real honor there. Most young gamers might not see anything spectacular about this game, but it should be noted that it was one of the first open world games of its kind so ignore the clunkiness and play it for what it is.

+ First GTA ever to be fully 3D 
+ Good graphics for the time (looks dated now, but tolerable)
+ Great gameplay for the time
+ Good arcade driving physics
+ Rockstar's first try of a story for the GTA series, and even if it's not great like later games, it was a nice start, with charismatic characters and voice dialog
+ The open world, now considered tiny, felt HUGE at the time
+ Good selection of weapons
+ Opponents can be dismembered by shots, something that is only possible in this game on the GTA series so far
+ Iconic cars like the banshee, Infernus and the Stallion were born in this game
+ There is a plane on the game, named ""dodo"" (a bird that couldn't fly), and it fits the name very well, since flying this thing is a challenge on its own. It's basically a minigame.
+ Nice soundtrack (Flashback FM is the best radio station, with the whole scarface movie soundtrack)
+ huge mod community



- Missions get quite hard at the end and can be frustrating, because of the respawn system (the hardest 3d game of the series IMO)
- You can't swim
- Motorbikes, helicopters, and planes (proper planes) were not present yet
- gets stretched visuals on widescreens (To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG)
- The shotgun and M16 are very OP, and can kill you ou blow up your car in a few shots (annoying on late game)
- by the end of the game, mostly everyone hates you, and cruising the map in certain areas can be very dangerous and annoying

However, once you apply these fixes the game becomes an entirely different beast, and you can truly see just why this series became the behemoth that it is. GTA III, the first 3D release in the series still plays incredibly well 15 years after release. Playing it is like going back and playing Doom after a while away - regardless of the passage of time, it's still an immensely enjoyable experience. I'd even argue that this game is a tighter and more polished than Vice City, even though VC is perhaps viewed as one of the best in the series. The cutscenes are slick and well-presented, and the cutscene character animation is perhaps superior to both VC and SA, the voice acting and sound design are all fantastic, and the gameplay is tight and fun. It's still a wonderful experience when the second island opens up and you can cruise around the big city for the first time. 

There is a degree of nostalgia affecting me here, and I can't say for sure whether the experience will entirely translate to those migrating back from V or IV, as this is the most arcade-y of the PS2 GTAs, but the gameplay, the characters, and the controls still hold up really well. I'm actually shocked how well the game has aged, again, providing you install the fixes I mentioned beforehand.

I don't know why it took  me so long I just never felt the need to play through the entire campaign. Then as a result of turning towards being a completionist I believed this would be an easy game to complete for the list. Boy was I wrong. Not to say the game is overly difficult like a game such as Dark Souls but there are certain aspects that lurk up on you making the process of any mission you try to do more difficult than it needs to be. For example one of my least favorite missions in the game is a street race on the very first island where you do one loop around the city. Seems easy enough. But no if you do this mission after doing some triad missions the men in blue (the triads) become hostile and it just so happens the start line for the race is heavily populated by this gang. This doesn't help the fact that almost every car in the game feel like trying to drive a tank at full speed (which you can do by the way) and it honestly seems the cars are made of paper mache at times as hoods, doors, and trunks come off with ease. Besides these facts I ended up just going to the start line, avoiding the triads of course, and right when it says go I leave my vehicle stare at the huge wreckage the poor street racers have made and enter the words BANGBANGBANG. Immediatley every vehicle on screen explodes. At this moment I am far enough away from everything so I did not get hurt. After this I spawn a tank and complete the race with the now non existent competitors. Things like this can happen very often in missions. Things that will them overly difficult to the point where you just start using cheats through the games just to beat it. After all is said and done I really can't reccomend completing this game as it is not worth while and there is no reward for doing so like other Grand Theft Auto games. I will still reccomend this game but only to those who really enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series and those of course who played it as a kid.

GTA III & Vice City are a pain in the @$$ to shoot or even kill the enemies.
So i've come with tips to help your @$$ steamroll your enemies. If you're using the controller mod this is directed towards you. If you're $#!t with the keyboard and mouse...... just give up on computer gaming it's not for you...

1. Never get into a fight without having Body Armor!
   Body Armor is not really avaliable at the start so if you're getting shot at you better book it.
2. Never get into to a gun fight without blocking yourself off with a car first.
    The A.I. will stop shooting at you if you're behind a car. So that will save you 90% of the time until the car blows up!
3. Never attempt to snipe at close range!
   You will get that @$$ hammered.................. so just don't.....pls.
4. Shooting enemies close range will also get yourself hammered
   Those A.I. will load clips in that @$$ so quick.......
5. DRIVE LIKE YOUR CAR IS YOUR FIRST BORN CHILD!!!!!!!!!!
   by midgame you're at war with like everyone.... If your car catches fire you will have to deal with close range enemies referring to #4 that's a really bad idea...

Liberty City. The city where the entire population doesn't knows how to swim, the police force specializes in aerial stunts. and going around stopped vehicles is unheard of. You play as Claude, the mute who might as well be blind. Claude has relationship issues, his girlfriend unexpectedly broke up with him, and Claude is doing what he can to get over it. 

STORY & ATMOSPHERE:
The story isn't something too spectacular. You are a criminal rising up through the ranks, and as your rise up you unveil enemies and get into a bigger mess. However, one thing to mention is the superb voice acting. The voice acting fits the atmosphere of the game very well, even on the radio.. The city feels like a cheap filthy restaurant filled with rodents. Everyone is on their own, or against you. Rats everywhere. Also, the radio stations have a diverse and interesting soundtrack. Varying with Reggae, DnB, 80s' classics, Opera, eccentric hipster Rock, and many more. Not to forget the humerous talk show hosted by the beloved Lazlow. However, radio stations get repititive after a while.

GAMEPLAY:
Hit detection is nearly non-existent and cars are very fragile, but the difficulty is great.The game can get very frustrating at times because of this. There is a considerable arsenal of weapons, from explosives to fire to bullets. But I found myself resorting to mostly sniping from afar (for the AI can't sense others' casualties), and running down enemies (as you are safe as long you're inside a vehicle). And thatis because most of the guns have terrible hit detection, deeming you almost  a sitting duck with heavy weapons, and a waddling penguin with light weapons. Vehicles get damaged so easily, bursting in flames and switching vehicles during a mission becomes a standard. The combination of being shot at and rammed into does not make it any better.  The difficulity rises as you progress, and so does the harshness of cops as you gain a wanted level. I'd say the difficulty is quite balanced for what it is.

For its time, this game was a masterpiece. It opened doors for many developers to go through, and Influenced many of the open-world games today. It has its issues, but I cannot deny how this game changed the gaming industry, and how it was truly genre-defining. If you are looking for a crime-based open-world classic game, try this.

And now, 15 years later, I look back and realized that nothing has changed and that this game still remains one of my favorites. I think it's safe to say that it influenced my life quite a lot - I learned to drive while playing it; I was learning English at the time and the game helped a lot; my music tastes were influenced by the radio stations. And when I was feeling blue, like I did a lot when in high school, I could escape in this approximation of the reality across the ocean. 

Sure, these days with newer games like GTA IV and V, the graphics are better, the plot is more twisted, guns are more abundant and the music is newer/different. I do like the newer games as well, so can't say they are worse than GTA III. But this one is the one that started the 3D Grand Theft Auto Experience, just like Black Sabbath started heavy metal.

PROS:
-Nice graphics that still hold up today in my eyes
-Nice radio stations with good music
-The immersion is fantastic, Liberty City feels alive, it really does feel like a smaller version of NYC
-The driving engine is rad, it feels nice with each car having its own feel and weight to it
-Fantastic characters, they all feel like real people, none of them are stereotypical
CONS:
-No motorcycles (but this doesn't really matter because this was the first 3D GTA game)
-Our main character Claude does not say a single word, this leaves SO much room for character development, not even in GTA SA does Claude say word (but it does tell us he owned a service station in San Fierro and he used to live in San Andreas and ran away to Liberty City wiht Catalina)
-The car's damage, it seems like they can be up in flames within seconds
-getting out of a vehicle on it's side, sometimes i am still stuck in the vehicle (vans and trucks), the vehicle sets ablaze and Claude is stuck 
-If you buy this on steam you will see that all the cars are dark, I had to download a different .exe file

Salvation is found in these two mods :
1) SilentPatchIII 1.1 Build 5
2) SP DDraw for GTA III/VC Build 4

Ah where do i begin.. i first played this game when i was 10 or 11 cant really remember and oh boy did i have shit ton of fun with this game. GTA 3 at its time was a masterpiece that barely any other game can come close to and raised the standard for the future Grand Theft Autos. The story was quite interesting and i wont spoil anything but in this game you are going to experience rollercoaster of emotions and explore all gangs in liberty city and get to know their plans etc.. 
The music is exquisite ranging from 80s,Reggae,Techno and even fucking Classical music.. yes you can listen to Beethoven while you drive over helpless civilians. This game has alot of cultural refrences and easter eggs you can discover scattered throughout the Liberty City. All in all you get quite a good package here and to consider what sort of crap we are getting today this is pure GOLD.

[CONS]
However i was quite dissapointed that our main character was bland as fuck... he cannot speak and most of the time he nods like a little baby.
Most of the cars are unstable as fuck and little oversteer will result in you being on a roof and resulting in a big boom.

Those who know what Grand Theft Auto, you can not tell about all the virtues of the new game. Perhaps You are faced with one of the first parts of the GTA. Even if not experienced, then now must face, because, finally, came the long-awaited third part. All series game wonderful total violence and aggression. In the new part, gamers are given complete freedom of action. Now you can smash, crush, kill, use any means at hand. The city is teeming with police cars, crime bosses.

You are a young offender, he found himself on the streets of liberty city. Yesterday You threw a friend. Anger boils inside, nobody wants to believe more. And then fate sends familiarity with well-known criminal authority, which sells explosives and engaged in other dark deeds. But, having worked with him a couple of dirty operations, you understand what it takes to start a business, and that working for a boss, it is hardly possible to achieve something in this life. After some deliberation You decide to go the private swimming, that is, to begin to do business on their own. In this way You will not be deprived by treachery, meanness, greed, and other human ""virtues"". But you chose this world this way, but because – ""I want to live – learn to spin"". The more that power is more than enough.

Liberty city is a huge computer world. They can just enjoy wandering the streets and riding in cars – simply living in this world. And, of course, a lot of kinds of quests and missions will diversify the already entertaining life. I would like to give advice – do not use the descriptions and passages of play – the only way You will get the greatest pleasure from the gameplay. But if you get stuck at some point – you should refer to the passage, because banging my head against the wall is rarely interesting.",1462431123,1462431123,True,7,3,0.564628243446350098,0,True,True,False,False,

We play as Claude, a young bank robber who is trying to make it in Liberty City. After a bank heist his girlfriend Catalina shoots Claude and leaves him for dead. After a prison break Claude escapes and so begins his quest for revenge towards Catalina.

The gameplay is pretty identical to every other GTA game, but I'll explain if you want to know. The game is a sandbox title where you are free to explore at your own pace, you can travel by foot, by car or by boat. No air travel just yet. It's fun driving around and seeing the sights in Liberty City.

The gameplay is very stiff for this title. The driving is very hard to control and requires a lot of time getting used to it, but once you're used to it, it's not big of a problem. 

The game also has a mission structure and every mission requires to do a lot of different stuff, ranging from racing, to hitman missions and a lot more stuff. A lot of the missions can be fun, but a lot of them are incredibly difficult and here is the biggest problem with the game.

Now don't get me wrong, when a game is challenging that is not bad, but when it's so hard it's next to the point of being unfair is not good. GTA Vice City and San Andreas has a good mixture of difficulty where the missions where possible no matter what. GTA 3 however is incredibly difficult due to the very confusing objective placements and really punishing missions where a few good placed shots could blow up your car.

The soundtrack is also really lackluster. Every radio station only has 4 songs each ( at least from what I remember). But a lot of the songs are good, so I won't go too harsh on it.

The story is really great, while not the best thing of all time, it helps to push you to the conclusion and it really satisfies you after the end credits start rolling.

While playing, I had zero issues with the game. No crashes, no game breaking bugs. Apart from minor AI glitches, I had no problems.

The game took me 13 hours to finish, after you're done, you also have races and packages you can collect all over Liberty City.

Overall GTA 3 is a good game, but it has not aged well since 2001. It's a revolutionary game and I won't deny the impact it had on the world of gaming, but I highly suggest players to buy either Vice City or San Andreas.

Final Rating:
6/10 - Worth Purchasing on Sale

The mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which can't be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly. The graphics and sound are dated but not terrible and the game's gritty atmosphere holds up.

A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tie-ins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 8-12 hours to complete for the average player.

Vice city and san andreas are easily 10/10 games to me, even though i want to i can't logically give gta 3 a 10 because there is no denying that the others are better.

You may ask, why it is still a must-play, when we have so many fine games of the same genre, with GTA V in the first place?

As usual, the point is in the impact this game made on the whole gaming world and all around it.

For example, when Ubisoft desired to make its own ""ala GTA"" product, they look namely on the GTA III as the base model. You can see the similarity with your own eyes: on the map, in the cars. Almost senseless vigilante Aiden Pierce is also not a big step from GTA3 protagonist Claude, even if he talks more, his behavior and usual activities are just about the same (except for ha-king, of course).

Seriously now, this game is not a history, it is a fine place to go even today. Camera and controls may be a bit tricky for start, but when you succeed with it - you'll get a nice trip into the underground world, one of the best interpretations in the whole criminal stories cluster. It is just as playable now as any of GTA ""clones"", like Sleeping dogs, Watch dogs et cetera... but it is original.

Well, for me this is one of those unforgettable things I'll carry in my life, with all tips, shortcuts and armor locations, which I remember, while not touching it for more than 10 years. But it is not about nostalgia. It is just really strong stuff. Maybe not the best in the line, maybe dated... But still pure and stout. Good taste.

Open-world classic that inspired dozens of clones and made Rockstar one of the most successful developers of all time.

However, the PC port of this game was poor on release and it's aged like milk. I've made a list of problems and solutions I had while getting it running:

[h1]Game launch crashes[/h1]
I had a lot of trouble getting this game to launch in Win10. I had to use both SilentPatch and the DDraw patch [url=https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/] found here[/url] to get past the Unhandled Exception c0000005 error and crash after the intro movie. These patches also fix a bug where menu text is either invisible or very faded.

[h1]Physics tied to FPS[/h1]
This is one of those old games where physics are tied to framerate. If you turn off the 30FPS limiter, car friction, jumping and running up stairs are totally broken. This is one of those things where someone at Rockstar could fix it in an afternoon but it's still broken after all these years.

As far as I know, there's no mod or patch to fix this. You can limit the game to 60 with a graphics driver tool but the physics problems are still there.

[h1]Broken HUD[/h1]
The HUD doesn't scale well for widescreen. There's a ""widescreen"" option in the graphics menu but it doesn't work. You need to use a community fix [url=https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp] found here[/url] to get the game to look as expected at resolutions like 1080p (or anything bigger than 1024x768).

[h1]Dark Cars[/h1]
The Steam version of the game has a bug where lighting doesn't affect cars if you're running it on a modern version of Windows. The SilentPatch I linked earlier fixes this bug, but the widescreen patch I linked breaks it again. The best way to fix this bug is adding [url=http://gtaforums.com/topic/816604-steam-car-colour-fix-gta-iii] this mod[/url].

[h1]Controller input[/h1]
GTA3 has decent support for DirectInput controls and that's good enough for me. There's plenty of people with Xinput controllers though.

San Andreas recently got a patch to support them but GTA3 hasn't had that patch yet despite using the same engine. [url=https://gtaforums.com/topic/562765-ginput/] Here[/url] is a mod that adds support along with the correct HUD buttons.

[h1]Y-axis sensitivity bug[/h1]
GTA3 was created in a time where the maximum DPI of a mouse was 600. Originally, both X and Y axis had customisable sensitivity but this was removed in the final release.

If you change mouse sensitivity in game (which everyone would, since it's designed for monitors with like 8 DPI), it only changes the X sensitivity while leaving the Y axis to go wild. There used to be a fix for this by ThirteenAG [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Y-Axis_Sensitivity_Fix_gta3vcsa/releases/tag/v1.0] here[/url] but it's no longer available.

[h1]Restore PS2 enhancements[/h1]
This one isn't a big issue (I don't use it) but this game was designed to take advantage of the PS2's hardware with stuff like real-time car reflections. They couldn't be bothered to port any of these enhancements to the PC version but there is a mod that restores PS2-like graphics to the game [url=http://gtaforums.com/topic/750681-] here.[/url] (Read the instructions though!)

[h1]100% completion checklist[/h1]
If you're a completionist, the in-game stats aren't useful at all. A member of the community made a 100% checklist that hooks the game ([url=https://github.com/Lighnat0r/100pc_checklist/tree/master/Released%20Versions%20Zipped]download here[/url]) and tells you what you still need to do if you're trying to complete the game 100%.

[h1]No in-game map[/h1]
Another not-huge issue but something to keep in mind before playing. As [url=https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200147316-Lack-of-in-game-map-in-GTA-III] Rockstar support[/url] points out, their huge game with 3 different islands has no in-game map, so you either have to memorise where everything is or follow their suggestion and [i]print out a map[/i] like it's 1999. 

[h1]Intro skipping[/h1]
Just a final tip to top everything off, once you've got the game running you can delete the ""movies"" directory from the install folder and it'll no longer play the intro movies. A little nugget that will save you a few seconds after spending 20 minutes or more getting the game running.

I do love this game but I can't honestly recommend GTA3 to anyone until they fix some of these issues.",1453653427,1546920526,False,14,5,0.582779765129089355,1,True,False,False,False,

I couldn't play this game as it is on Steam. The control schemes are too wonky and rebinding them is way more difficult than it should be.

Gameplay is solid, it's fun to drive around, sadly the world is small and dead and there's not much to do aside from the missions.

Radio is horrible, with only one good music station (Flashback), two stations that have a couple good songs (Lips and Head) and an amazing Chatterbox with Lazlow. When I got tired from music I listened to him non stop. All other stations are worthless.

Some characters have broken motivation for their actions. Plot is semi-non existent. It's told in little bits, just so that we can get the picture, but it fails at being a mosaic that we put together and ends up distant from the player. And the ending is anti-climactic.

In the end it's not enough. Playtime is decent, it took me 18 hours to complete, with exploration, side missions and package retrieving. But the plot could've used some more depth. Characters could've been drawn out better. They appear and dissapear and slip out of the mind.

Lots of action, guns, blood (kind of), murders and fun.

Also, the voiceacting in general was not necessarily all that great.

Assuming you can get it to run.

I myself had no major problems on Windows 8.1, though I'm reading reviews of problems on Windows 10 and some of the other newer OSes.   One fix I found, and this applies to GTA Vice City and San Andreas as well, is to ENABLE Vsync.  The games aren't really meant to be played at today's ridiculously high framerates, and as such, this can fix a lot of timing and control related issues.

But if you can get it to run, just, holy crap.  There is elegance in this game's design and relative simplicity compared to the later entries that makes it enthralling like few other games out there.  IMHO, it still holds up extremely well, even compared to it's sequels.

Even if this game doesn't work, you can ask Steam for a refund, then use that money to get the PS2 version for like $2 new on Amazon or something.  It won't be AS good as this version, but it'll still be an amazing experience.  So yes, I recommend this game.",1448097083,1448097083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Encountered problems (that I do not consider just a bug):

-Cutscenes freeze and can cause the game to crash
-Entities appear in the wrong place (glitched) in cutscenes
-Controls frequently become unresponsive or get stuck (I have sticky keys disabled)
-Main menu text can become invisible until Steam overlay is viewed (possibly just a Steam overlay bug)
-Possibly other bugs that I have not yet encountered, and do not wish to on the risk of not qualifying for a refund

I do not know if any of the above is encountered with Windows 8, but I have played a standalone copy of GTA III on Windows 7 and can confirm that it works fine.

I know it might be odd to some people in 2015 but PC gaming hardware back then (when the game was released) wasn't what it is today with the whole PC Master concept, back then PC gaming hardware was inferior to the consoles, so the developers downgraded the graphics and mechanics so that people's computers would not catch fire and blow up.

So unless they go back fix the terrible controls, and add features they had previously removed in the PC version to accommodate the new hardware, I wouldn't recommend this version of the game to anyone.

im gonna give you an honest review and none of that ""this game is perfect because of nostalgia"" bullshit.

PROS:
-Looks and runs very nice in 1080p. some games look streched and washed out when trying to play in HD 
but GTA III handles it like half-life,fear and red faction, 
-Missions are justly rewarded (so funding future missions isnt an issue,looking at you liberty city stories)
-plenty to do (side missions,RC racing,collecting packages ect)
-A loose but entertaning story (not tight enough to have lore but entertaining,especially if youve played LCS)

CONS:
-FUCK THE RISING BRIDGE TO SHORESIDE VALE.
-No map (why they didnt think to implement it in a patch ill never know)
-No purchasable armor (late game after locations have been memorized its not really and issue but early game its a bitch)
-No motorcycles (this can be overlooked since the idea probably hadnt been though of yet)

I really really like this game. Even if it's old, it's still better than VC, better than SA... 

 I'm not sure it's also better than IV & V ... I haven't played them, I have a really old computer....

Some missions are really hard, if you are not used to  play fps games... It can be very annoying to aim, and you have to be quick too (which I am not)... 

Anyway ... I like the way it can feel casual, you can cruise around all you like. I like driving taxi's around and make money, finding secret packages, selling cars for cash... You can even grab a policecar or ambulance and go on vigilante-missions, while listening to the 9 different radiostations, or your own mp3 player ... This was so original, back when the game released... 

You start the game on an island called Portland, the bridge to the other areas are closed due to repairs... First time you drive around in Portland can be very confusing, but as you learn the map, you can easily make you way around. 

When you have completed like at least 10 missions the bridge will be repaired. That means there is a whole new area to get to know, it is a pretty big map, and you can get lost pretty quick. There are new cars, new secrets and some new weapons I think- 

Some CONS:
I have completed half the game, but got stuck on a really tough mission.... Some missions have a timer, but most don't. There are usually multiple ways you can complete the missions... It would have been awesome if you could skip the missions that are too hard, and I wish I could just save the game at any time... But i still love this game...

GTAIII offered excellent open world game play and map design with a plethora of interesting characters and a compelling story mode set in the underworld of an alternative New York. Too bad it didn’t age nearly as well as the next two games.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
When it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location (Liberty City, an alternative New York), many characters, and things like the top-down driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.
They fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like third-person gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.

Exploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute small-time gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.
The plot is grim, but the execution isn’t so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumer-oriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.

The gameplay and controls by today’s standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isn’t really suited for post Windows XP systems. But if you ever want some GTA nostalgia, this is the best place to start.",1438601171,1438601171,True,7,0,0.565854132175445557,0,True,False,False,False,

The game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly.  This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine. 

In GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.

The graphics are dated but it is over ten years old, what were you expecting? You can get graphically enhancing community made mods to increase the fidelity a bit too. I personally really like these dated looking graphics.

GTA III will challenge you at points; more so that you will probably end up dying quite a bit. Some missions require a lot of shooting and evading police, while others involve a little bit of parkour and trying not to just kill yourself in a stupid manner. The re-spawn system is very good in GTA though; you loose all your weapons as well as having to pay a fee for the hospital having to patch you up. 

As you can see, I have over a hundred hours in GTA III, this is through having multiple playthroughs, as well as completing the game 100% on a number of occasions; however this past week I did a full playthrough of the story and a couple of the side activities and this took me almost twelve hours to complete. There is a ton more content to play in that playthrough too, so you can easily get about fifteen plus hours out of one playthrough of GTA III if you desire. 

Oddly enough I had no real game breaking technical issues with GTA III, the only one I did find is it is not recommended to play this game with more than one monitor activated at a time, as your mouse will sometimes wander out of the game window and you will end up minimizing your game all the time. To be honest though; just the one issue on a ten year old game is pretty good going if you ask me. 

In conclusion, GTA III is a land mark in gaming history; it is the game which revolutionized the GTA series, sparked media controversy, and most of all, gave us one of the best games in history. Most will have already completed this game; however if you haven't - I strongly advise you dust your copy off and give it a weekend of your time to play.

Both Vice City and S.A have solid gameplay and story that hold up to this day, this game however does not. Every single critique of this game I have is fixed in Vice City. The story is weak, it’s a revenge tale and yet the main character Claude shows no emotions nor speaks throughout the entire game. You feel empty at the end because it never seemed as if Claude ever cares about anything. You betray characters at a dime for no reason. There is no map, and the mini-map doesn’t tell you where the pay and spray and ammunition are so you have to literally learn the streets. You have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on nothing (except guns but good luck finding the ammunation). There are only 3 hideouts and they all look like shit, for a millionaire Claude sleeps on the floor on the concrete. Every single gang in the game except one is out to kill you and have laser sharp aim. The camera is terrible and will get you killed. The crosshair is not correctly calibrated, bullets go outside of the circle and to the right in the exact same position always, so it is not a glitch but poor programing. The music is terrible, and theirs only about 3 1/2 hours of radio for a 20 hour game. A single station will only have about 20 minutes or about 5 songs each game so it gets extremely repetitive. The map is sectioned off by three bridges, each island is incredibly small. The reason why this is a problem is that there is no map and the game will have missions where you have to travel across islands against the clock. Since there is no map you will fail missions simply because you can’t find the bridge. Cars die in 5-8 hits. The best way to restore your health is to kill yourself because hookers take too long and finding health power-ups is at best random since there is no map and they are not labeled on the minimap. There is armor in the game but I never in 17 hours found it, not once! The handling of the cars is awful and will get you killed since cars can only take 6-8 hits.

Any title is awesome (besides GTA IV's PC port, but that's on a performance's POV) and GTA III is the first of three games that are set on III's universe, therefore Rockstar names it the GTA III trilogy. I mainly played the game again for nostalgia (remember, it's from 2002, I know right, time goes by so fast) and for the fact that I hadn't truly completed the game in the past. Setting that aside, GTA III's story is not original but it's only a pretense for the crazy missions you will be doing. You will always have some people (you get to work with the mafia, yakuza, etc) your character goes to, to receive a mission, then on and on until you complete all of them. Voice acting is pretty impressive considering the game's age, and there many bugs that irritated me (coming down the stairs and getting launched into the air...) but nonetheless it was a great experience. I don't know if I should really recommend GTA III because you will probably just be playing GTA V.

So many things are difficult to tolerate, like the lack of map to find important locations (many times i've been searching for hospital in vain... and it's an exemple), horrible physics where you can fail a job because you car turned upside-down due to a carton box. Missions without appropriate briefing (Exemple: the Mafia asks you to kills some Triad Warlords and at the end you have to find a fish van... the problem you have 2 or 3 types of fish vans...).
Or, something weird, when you go to Liberty City down town (well in fact you stay there around 2/3 of the game), you see some Triad gangs in cleaner suits shooting at you on sight even if you drive a Firefighter truck... as if you wrote MAFIA THUG on your face/ vehicle.


So even if some games on Steam are very old, i still buy them to remember their uniq aspects they represented in their time.
Like the first Quake games wich are still very cool and keep entertaining even today, or reworked oldies such as Strifer: Veteran edition, and many others.

To Conclude :

Maybe i will finish GTA III when they will do some kind of ""polishing"" on it.
But frankly my First GTA experience in 3D was and will stay: GTA Vice City.
Beautifull, Fun, Cool and just unforgettable.

And the funny thing that nobody says about GTA III is that the hero never talks....
Contrary to Tommy Versetti  in Vice City, who is one of the best characters the franchise has.
Like so many like Ken Rosenberg, Tommy's lawyer who appears in San-Andreas with Kent Paul.


Even the soundtrack is boring, like Razlow on GTA III who works in a debate radio and in Vice City he is a crazy 80's Rock radio presenter !

Nostalgia can be painfull some times and GTA III is painfull...
go play Vice City instead !


N.B: My play time doesn't show my experience because i played offline for quite a long time.
And i think i will review Vice City after that.",1430066546,1430066785,False,2,0,0.439108490943908691,0,True,False,False,False,

It's been said that this game pales in comparison to the games that would come later in the 'GTA III trilogy', namely Vice City and San Andreas.  While it's true that those games further refined and expanded upon the GTA experience in important ways, the essential building blocks for those changes were created here in GTA III.

I've trumped up the historical importance of the game a bit but the question remains as to whether the gameplay in GTA III has held up, especially in relation to the later iterations in the series.  Thankfully I can answer that with a resounding, ""Yes!""  So let's talk about some of the things that make this game tick.  First and foremost, we have the story.  In GTA III Rockstar was pinning down some of the aspects that would come to be regarded as the Rockstar style of storytelling.  The story here is basically a love letter to latter day crimeland movies like Goodfellas, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, and the like.  In this capacity all the requisite pieces are in play, including the Italian mafia, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, as well a healthy assortment of street level thugs.  You are a mute protagonist (who we would later know as Claude thanks to GTA: San Andreas), making a name for himself on the back of jobs from all these various criminal factions.  Naturally there are betrayals, double-crosses, hits and feints between all of these organizations, and Rockstar handles its authorial pen deftly enough to keep the story moving at a good pace.  The whole story has the tone and feel of a pulp crime movie you might see as part of a matinee crime movie marathon; nothing of great substance, but a whole lot of fun nevertheless.

In GTA III we also see the beginnings of Rockstar's tendency to include well-known actors performing voice work in their games.  Here we have Michael Madsen, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Rappaport, Debi Mazar, Kyle MacLachlan, and gangster movie legend Frank Vincent all playing supporting roles in the game.  The caliber of voice acting in this game really does some great things for the conveyance of the story.  In the hands of lesser actors, certain aspects of this story might have come off as laughably cringe-worthy.  As it is we are treated to voice work performed by old pros, particularly where crime drama is concerned.

Here we are also treated to the first GTA game to include an absolutely killer soundtrack complete with genre specific radio stations, distinct DJs for each radio station, and some great licensed music.  It had been quite a few years since I played this game, and these tunes (as well as spoken dialog) really filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  In truth it's the radio stations that give this game its comedic timing and fantastically dark sense of humor.  As an added bonus, the PC port of this game allows you create a custom playlist of mp3s which can be imported into the game.  I really had a great time importing my own tunes into the game.  Once you do so, the 'MP3 Player' becomes selectable in any vehicle just like a normal radio station which plays your tracks on random repeat.  Let me tell you that you haven't lived until you've gone on a drive-by rampage with Electric Wizard's Funeralopolis blaring from the sound system of your Patriot.  >=D

The gameplay mechanics are admittedly somewhat long in the tooth at this point, but even still they are pretty darned enjoyable.  The drifty, somewhat floaty driving mechanics that are a hallmark of 3D GTA games make their debut here.  At first the driving might seem a slightly off, being that I don't know of any other driving game that handles quite like the GTA games.  The handling is a bit loose, but once you get that part dialed in it's a real blast.  Of course the looseness of vehicle handling depends a lot on what vehicle you're in at any given time.  It does need to be said that there are no motorcycles in GTA III, which for me is perhaps one aspect of the later games that I missed the most here.  There are also no helicopters, and only one (notoriously difficult to control) aircraft.  That said, the variety of vehicles available here is suited well to the game, and I feel that the slightly limited selection of vehicles can be forgiven being that we are talking about the first GTAs first foray into full 3D.

This was my first play though of the Steam PC port of GTA III, and I will say that I found some relatively minor issues with the port.  First and foremost, the aiming mechanics were … problematic for me in this version.  In the 'Classic Control' scheme, the relatively responsive nature of the auto-targeting feature found in the console version of the game just doesn't carry over very well in the PC version.  It fails to reliably switch between targets, and in many cases it fails to [i]find[/i] any targets at all (despite the fact that said targets are in the process of filling you with lead).  Furthermore, when you're using the Classic Control scheme the right thumb stick puts you in first person look perspective rather than adjusting the 3rd person camera as one might expect.  Others may have had a slightly different experience with Classic Mode controls, but for me the combination of the above factors made this option a non-starter.  The 'Standard Control' scheme makes some marked improvements to the above, but in this case you're stuck strictly with free aiming.  I tend to prefer keyboard & mouse controls for games that require free aiming, and indeed given that strafing features prominently into the Standard Control scheme in GTA III, one might assume that KB+M is what the developers had in mind here … except that KB+M makes driving nearly impossible (although not [i]entirely[/i] impossible as I do know at least one person that beat this game entirely with KB+M).  Using the Standard Control scheme, I ultimately ended up ruling in favor of using a controller to better facilitate driving, although I did find a helpful mod that made this option a bit more feasible.  The [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=172881491]GInput mod[/url] allows you to fully utilize an Xinput device in GTA III which makes using a controller in the game a bit more palatable, and has the added benefit of additional customizable settings.  It even swaps out correct button icons for onscreen prompts.  So there's that.

On my (Nvidia-based) gaming rig there were also a couple of graphical glitches present in this port.  Most noticeably I encountered the 'dark vehicles' glitch, in which all the vehicles appear to have a much darker tint than they should.  For this issue I applied a second light weight user-made patch to the game which resolved the issue promptly.  If you find yourself with the same problem, [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1859227]this fix[/url] is probably worth your time as well.

At the end of the day, the question is whether or not this game is still worth your time.  Given the popularity (and occasional notoriety) enjoyed by the GTA series, you probably already know whether the source material is your cup of tea.  Dark comedy, violence, and debauchery abound!  If you're already a fan of the series, or if you're looking to get into the 3D era of GTA games at the ground floor, I would say that this game still holds a lot of enjoyment even today.  It had been a number of years since I last played this game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected I would especially given the historical perspective of subsequent GTA games.

This is the game that made every other GTA games what they are today.

You play as Claude who got betrayed and shot by his girlfriend after a heist. Wounded but not dead, you find yourself arrested and transported to prison but you evade from your transport when the colombian cartel makes an attack on the patrol you are stuck into to help another prisonner to escape. You use this opportunity to beat a police officer, remove your handcuffs and evade from your transportation truck. You learn about 8-Ball and he helps you with his contacts.
Roaming around Liberty City to do missions for the Mafia, the Yakuza and some independent names, you are thrown around to do the dirty jobs like the handyman you are.

The map is huge and the game looks good when you think about the games that came out around the same years.
It's in the veine of the GoldSrc Engine, Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 but with a big map made with free-roaming in mind. Driver 2 would be a better comparison. Restating that GTA3 was the first attempt from Rockstar to make a 3D game, They didn't miss their shot. 

There's a lot of things to do.
The missions are non-linear, you always have the choice between a mission giver or another, there's the phone boot side-quests, you can do Taxi, Ambulance and Police missions when you get the specific car and you can always free-roam in Liberty City causing carnage for fun and giggles.

The sound effects are great, you always feel like you're in a real city with the car sounds and pedestrians talking.
A gunshot disturbs the peace of the moment when everyone start screaming and running.
The game is immersive, you feel like you're there, walking/running around in Liberty City.

There's enough weapons to have fun the entire game. There's not three different sets like in San Andreas but the game isn't that long either. Everything is well balanced for its size and for it's date of creation.

The physic in the game is alright, not perfect but very good for what it needed to be.
The driving physic is sometimes weird, you feel like in a pinball machine when you start hitting everything around but otherwise, handbrakes, quick turns and donuts can be done easily. Depending on the car you have, controlling it is never that much of a pain unless it's a really bad car which was obviously a choice from the devs. Bad cars roll badly.

The shooting mecanics are archaic to say the least, it's kinda hard hard to deal with when you are in a fire fight, mostly when you are surrounded. The game was made to be unforgivable in some ways.
When you try to play wisely, you get into cover and you try to step a little bit outside of your cover in a way that the AI doesn't really see you and then you shoot. ... or you try to stay in front of the enemies, hoping that you will kill everyone before you die. Good luck if they have decent weaponry. It's not impossible and it's still a lot of fun.
You can only shoot and walk with the UZI or pistol, every big weapons are used as if you were a turret which is kind of annoying sometimes but the bullet effects are eye candy though. It's always fun to make your own justice anyway. 

I don't have a lot of negative to say about this game.
Most negative points would come from a comparison with the futur games which wouldn't be fair at all.
Every futur installments added stuff to what GTA3 was. GTA3 doesn't lack stuff, it's just the next games that are even better than what was this awesome game.

There's obviously some glitches and bugs since it's a first attempt at a 3D game but nothing gamebreaking.
A problem I had was that the game version I have was censored for whatever reason.
I'm not from a country renowned to ban such games and I bought the game in the official Rockstar Pack with every other GTA games directly on Steam. The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.

To end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with. Give it a try with an open mind! Feel the year 2001.",1427934904,1427934904,True,1,0,0.498141288757324219,0,True,False,False,False,

Yes it misses features from later games such as buying property and motor bikes amongst other things but this game is still top notch.

Do not dismiss my review for my short play time. I have 100% the game twice on other platforms. GTA III changed games as we knew them. This game brought violence, grit, pure unfiltered satire of out modern society into a massive openworld game. 

-----Story 10/10-----------
You play as someone who has been cheated on. You are double crossed during a robbery by your girlfriend and left to rot in jail. Luckily you dont make it that far. Your convoy is interrupted and you manage to escape. You need money to climb the ladder and get revenge on the people that wronged you. The characters and people you meet are the seediest of their kind. Mobsters, pimps, dealers, the common criminal. You do work for them to get the paper. 

-----Gameplay 8/10--------
For a game with nothing to take ideas from this game works surprisingly well. The guns are weak at first, but as you unlock more the shootouts get better. Cars play the biggest part in this game. The city is pretty big and you will need to get around quick. The handling is a bit unrealistic and there is nothing as annoying as flipping a car and having it blow up on you, but speeding around the city is amazing.

------Graphics 5/10------
What did you expect for a game from 2001. The people are blocky and the terrain can be muddy at times but in its time it looked damn good.

-----PC Port 5/10---------
I originally played this on the playstation two and a bit on the iphone for the mobile edition. Honestly the PC port is pretty bad. You will probably need to run it in compatibility mode to get it to work at all. Even so it does crash from time to time. 

-------Overall game is 10/10 (This version gets a 7/10)-----
I would reccomend this game to anyone looking to have some fun. This will probably forever be one of the greatest video games. I just wish the PC port was better.",1421516205,1421516205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Suffice to say, I've managed to reconcile the problem since then (15 years ago) and it works beautifully. I suggest modding it a bit to make it look and play like a more modern GTA of today. (OnePiece's HD Cars and Tri-Pack plus some much needed improved HD city textures will allow it to look a bit more fresh) It's a classic and one of the best GTAs to try and get 100% in since it's one of the easiest to do so in. Also, I recommend switching out Steam's EXE with a regular 1.1 version if you want to avoid the dark colored cars problem. Editing the TXD file works too but changing the EXE won't break the game.

I bought this game when it was on special. This is a very addictive open world shooter game. The soundtrack is rich and diverse. Lots of tunes from classic artists to get pumping. Missions are challenging yet it is very fun to play. You can nver get sick of this game. I played this game from the beginning till the end. Storyline wise is epic.

Maxed out graphics on almost every machine built after 2004.

Supports MP3 playback.
Cons:
AI and player movement is jacked up slightly - cars crash randomly, people jumping into road etc.
Reversal is nearly IMPOSSIBLE in some vehicles depending on terrain.
Unhandled exception error is tedious to fix.
Missions are repetitive and redundant at times.

[b] (TL;DR? go to the end) [/b]

The game starts you off as a silent criminal who just got free from a prisoner transport and looks for work. Eventually, a mob guy named Luigi helps you out and you work your way up. I won't get into the rest because I know most people have played it. I mean, it's even on phones. The story, though simple, is great.

The missions are a blast, some are super short driving tasks, others are all out adventures. None of them are too long and are great for killing time if you got 30-45 minutes to spare.

Some of the best moments are when you're simply trying to end a mission, but manage to get stuck with 4+ stars on your wanted level. Can't end the job? Well, killing off cops and raming through their forces in hopes to lose them or hide is incredibly fun. Thrilling I would go as far as to say.

With the exception of the horrible looking people, this game actually doesn't look too bad. Even though it came out in the early 2000's.

The controls could be better, as could gamepad support, but some tweaking fixes it.

As for the soundtrack, it could be better. Vice City has a better one, and I'm saying that as someone that doesn't really like 80's music.

As for how this game runs, oh god, if you're on Windows 8... It is hell.

Windows 8/8.1 users beware: The game will crash, with only about a 2 out of 10 chance of making it past the R* logo. Because the W8 developers had this ""wonderful"" idea of ""out with the old, in with the new"" games that were made from this era tend to not work. It could be worse, I mean at least it occasionally runs. But seriously microsoft, Windows 10 better run this game, or I'm buying the classics version on PS3. I already supported Rockstar and Valve by buying it here, and I'm going to support Sony next. But not you, MS. Fix windows and let me play my damn game. It's not like I'm buying this on Xbox, so if that was your plan with making Windows 8 without 16/32-bit program support, you guys are pretty freaking stupid. Hell, this game even runs on Mac and iPhones! [i] F***ing Mac and iPhones! [/i]

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

+ The game's storyline is quite good, it follows the main character Claude as he works for the Mafia, Yakuza and other parties throughout Liberty City, while simulataneously seeking revenge against his ex-girlfriend for backstabbing him during a robbery.
+ You feel a connection to all the central characters in the game and they're very intriguing.
+ As with every Grand Theft Auto game, you have the ability to cause complete mayhem, using flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades, military grade assault rifles, pistols, shotguns and more. Great weapon choices.
+ Side missions available and hidden packages/frenzy tasks to complete. Extra content there.
+ Graphics are dated but for the time period (2001) they were amazing. This won't impact on your fun.
+ Nice music on radio stations, adds to the enjoyment.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

- Short game, takes around 20 hours to finish, side missions included. I'll admit i've finished the game multiple times in the past, so this could vary if you're new. But generally, it's short.

The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the ""loyalty"" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.

Ultimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the ""controversy"" aspect.

Then this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.

Corners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make ""Crazy Taxi"" almost entirely redundant.

Whilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.",1416172145,1416172145,True,0,0,0.450512409210205078,0,True,False,False,False,

Hello again friends! Like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I have been playing Grand Theft Auto III since its release date back in 2001. When this game was first released it was revolutionary! The first 3D Grand Theft Auto! Amazing, truly amazing. The storyline is excellent (FUCK YOU, CATALINA!) and the soundtrack is actually not that bad (listen to Rise, MSX, Flashback FM, Head Radio and last but not least Double Cleff FM). The only downfall to this game was not including the beautiful and talented Misty into more missions. What a shame. Anyways, if you are sitting here reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy Grand Theft Auto III I say buy it RIGHT NOW. It is a classic. Also like Vice City, this game was made when Rockstar actually cared about gameplay more than appearance. So if that doesn't make you want to buy this game I don't know what will. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules and I sincerely hope that I have influenced your opinion on Grand Theft Auto III and your choice on games.

Yours in gaming,

However, this game does not hold up too well in 2014. Easily the shortest GTA game clocking in at 14 hrs with full mission completion. While it may have been revolutionary in 2001, it pales it comparison to later titles in the series. The characters can be best described as one note and underwritten. Claude is easily the least compelling protagonist not just in the GTA franchise, but in gaming in general. Having him silently take orders and essentially betraying anyone and everyone, the story leaves off with most gangs in Liberty City hating you. Rather than rise to the top of the criminal pyramid, Claude elects instead to kill and betray anyone at the slightest suggestion. 

The controls for driving and shooting are solid, especially on PC. However, any mission involving AI can become frustrating very quickly. Some missions feel completely unrealistic and contrived, with fail states that can only be described as nonsensical. Most of this game's length can be accounted for by repeatedly failing some of the tougher missions. In almost all the firefights, the enemies simply camp around a corner and wait for their cheap shot. Death can come from myriad unfair game mechanics and can lead to some genuine frustration that is not to be found in later titles. 

If you are interested in the GTA franchise, this is not the place to start. I would recommend Vice City, San Andreas, or GTA IV. These games boast far better AI as well as much MUCH better stories and characters.

Controls: A major hurdle.  For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken.  After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around.  I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire.  However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will.  When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky.  I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller.  The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely.  Workable, but flawed.

Gameplay:  I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards.  It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then.  GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety.  This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms.  One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played.  The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience.  If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.

Story:  Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background.  Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting.  On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.

Graphics:  This is not a pretty game.  I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out.  The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.

Sound:  Very good.  There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle.  These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to.  The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in.  This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings.  The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving. 

Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them.  I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.",1407720865,1414955664,True,5,1,0.551056325435638428,1,True,False,False,False,

In 2001 Rockstar games released this title and made history and pretty much everyone has played this game and knows what's it about, but the question is - while being a ground breaking title more than 10 years ago, is it worth playing now and how it has aged ? 

So game looks pretty good, for the time and even now-days  the graphics feels tolerable. It features day & night cycles and dynamic weather. Environment is pretty huge and worth exploring, you'll find some hidden weapons, side missions etc.
Voice acting is done pretty well, however recordings them selves are at pretty low quality, game has several radio stations with different styles of music and tracks, however I disliked pretty much every soundtrack, but maybe thats just me and for the time that music was actually pretty cool.

Story is really generic, with you leveling up and making name for yourself in underground crime scene. Game had descent number and variety of missions, starting with some more simple and ending with some quite creative goals for the time, sometimes even involving whole map. It took me about 13 hours to complete the story and do about 40-60% of side stuff.

One aspect where game have aged terribly is the game play it self. Car handling is good, but physics sometimes are just awkward and bizarre and sometimes slightest hit can make your car flip and spin like in first flat out game. Gun controls also are pretty weird, were you have to often aim at where bullets are going not where crosshair is pointed. 
Missions themselves are quite challenging and more than often i found myself replaying same missions more than 3 times in row. 

At the end i would recommend this game if you somehow missed this title, to see where sandbox genre has started. If you want to go and get some nostalgic feel than it's a mixed bag, with some things cool and fun to play while others just being aged and a bit frustrating. 

I guess at the time game was mind blowing and had earned a lot of 10/10s, but today for me game feel's like solid 7.0.

It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things.

Replayability, unfortunately, is one of GTA III's shortcomings as there's not much to engage in after the main story has been passed, save for rather bland side missions, and blowing up Liberty City for the 100th time, there's not much after to look forward to. 8.6/10",1403404510,1419985574,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Pros:
HUGE open-world, which seems to live on its own.
Popouri of various game types: shooting, driving, racing, melee.
Excellent sense of humor with Pop culture references.
LOW hardware requirements; a netbook could run GTA3.
Gamepad support, both Direct Input (Logitech) and Xinput (360 controller).*

Old, 6th gen (PS2/Xbox/Gamecube/Dreamcast era) graphics.

It certainly looks dated and a lot of features were missing (e.g. shooting out vehicle tires) that later on made the gameplay really good, still, it is a classic and there's nothing wrong with looking at where GTA came from.

Even today it is nice to see that 10 years ago someone could make a game with a huge city full of side missions to complete. I suggest that those of you who love the GTA franchise pick this one up if discounted and spend at least two weekends to see where the series came from. And yes, I know this is out on smartphones along with Vice City, but I'd stick to the good-old keyboard and mouse combo instead of tapping a small screen.",1397119439,1397119439,True,7,0,0.594334065914154053,0,True,False,False,False,

If I consider how I felt when I first picked up the game when it was released, it was a total breath of fresh air to the gaming market and redefined the much taken for granted ‘sandbox’ genre. Graphically impressive with a fluid control system, the gaming world seemed huge with endless activities to do and a thrilling narrative populated by great characters. Although some of these aspects still remain true, I would honestly suggest remaining with fond memories of this game as opposed to trying to relive its glory, as out of the three PS2 GTA games (III, Vice City and SA) it has aged extremely badly (by far the worst) and is only just about playable.

The main issues are the controls and the targeting system. Much like other gamers, I am accustomed to using a controller for the GTA series. Although it can be difficult, it is possible to get your PS3/Xbox controller to work in sync with this game, however the thought of having to map the controls or download specific programmes yourself may put gamers off from the offset. If you get past this hurdle, you’ll notice that targeting in the game is extremely difficult. There is not an ‘auto-lock’ target option, which is highly inconvenient and makes missions that involved killing enemies who can target you very easily frustrating. Aiming with rifles is obviously manual, but to point a tiny aim reticule using the right analogue stick/mouse at a cartel enemy gunning you down from 5 yards is nearly impossible, meaning that you have to take out most enemies from range using the sniper rifle or grenades/rocket launcher. When the action is so fast paced and often in close proximity to the protagonist, it’s very easy to fail a mission because you couldn’t kill an enemy at point blank range.

Although it is not apparent at first, the lack of a map is also a frustration. You do have a mini-map, but if you want a more global view of where you need to be, or where the closest ammunition store is, it really is a case of drive around and hope. During several missions, the enemy/location markers span all three islands and it can be confusing where to go, or at least, where the quickest route is (as many missions are timed), if you cannot get a global map view. If this happens during several missions, you will quickly get fed up with the experience and quit prematurely. 

The graphics are still acceptable, especially since we consider that this game was released over a decade ago. The main aspect of the game that is never lost is the humour and pop culture satire, which may make the game playing in itself. The radio stations in particular are still hilarious to listen to, Chatterbox and the commercials specifically. If you can get the game cheap enough on a sale, perhaps just reliving some of Lazlo’s best lines would be enough to justify the purchase. 

The gaming world compared with any game in the last five years is tiny. It should be noted however that I thought this was a huge game in scope when it was released, however the whole main storyline can be completed relatively swiftly, barring any mission fails based on the bad targeting/map system. The three main islands can be driven across in the matter of minutes, yet on a positive note the vehicles still seem varied enough to make the process fresh and enjoyable. However, it does of course seem limited in comparison to its sequels. Furthermore, vechiles that we may consider certainties in Vice City and SA such as bikes, flyable planes (the Dodo does not count) and fast boats are void here, and the lack of a mission ‘replay’ option that was so well received in later instalments is obviously non-existent in GTA III.

It is very difficult to click the ‘do not recommend’ option for this game as it offers so many good memories combined with great humour, however it is better to remember this game how it was. Other than for a quick nostalgia trip, the gameplay missions are tiresome since they have been done and done better since the newer instalments of GTA, so many of them have been done a hundred times before. That, combined with difficult controls and no larger map, means that this game has sadly not stood the test of time. It is important to remember of course that GTA III redefined these sorts of missions and gameplay style and should be celebrated as a landmark game, however I’m not sure if playing this game start to finish will give gamers much joy.

I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.

In case you've never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which ""lives"" - you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish (usually involving driving and shooting), explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.

The game's story puts a low-down person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. I've played through this game multiple times and while it's ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.

I have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply there's a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if that's your thing, it's worth a look. At any rate, this is a classic which should be a part of anyone's collection. Very, very highly recommended.",1392712473,1392712473,True,3,0,0.548887491226196289,0,True,False,False,False,

As most of the players know the GTA series, the only thing with GTA3 is the crude ""PS2-like"" GFX, as it was originally released for PS2 in 2001 but the disappointing part for the PS2 version is the lack of compatibility for the later revision model of the PS3 and PS4. The Steam version however may contain some GFX colour errors when you play in-game like the vehicles with a distinctive yellow glow; plus your saves from the PC Retail Version - that if you choose to transfer into the Steam Version may corrupt it.

Overall this game is enjoyable, and it's generally for over 18s only, plus it does contain some racist stunts and footage: like the Italian Mafia going into Mob Wars with the Chinese Triads. And if you proceed after going into Mob Wars with the Triads and siding with the Diablos, then your chances of survival in the city will be reduced, due to the mobsters trying to take revenge against YOU! So, if you do want to make a 100% complete stats, then I recommend you stay away from other jobs except Luigi's. Because those Taxi, Police and Fire Engine jobs will be impossible if the mobsters start severely opposing you. And don't fail and save when you play on those ""Kill Frenzy/Ramage"" missions as those are a 1-way ticket.

Speaking of 1-way tickets: If you approach near Mission ""Bomb Da Base - Act II"", then be aware of Luigi's, Joey's and Toni's jobs, because if you not finished them all, you will never get the 100% completion. Same goes when you reach Staunton Island if you not finished the Jobs from Kenji when you get Donald Love's Jobs. And when you get a Mission from Shoreside Vale, except the PayPhone from Southside Hoods, DON'T buy anymore weapons. Trust me you need the cash for the final showdown.

Now I believe this game appears to be the only game in the GTA 3D series onwards that don't reduce your Criminal Rating stats, so you can cause some cheating mayhem as you want. But don't use them for the newer versions of GTA as those Stats will be ruined.

One final thing, you can download some fixes like the Long Distance enhancement and some of Silent's DirectDraw fixes for this game. Try it! It should be safe:

Guess I'll begin with a personal opinion here. Personally I think this is the best GTA. At least it is my favorite. To me, it beats San Andreas and Vice City. And unlike GTA IV (or mabye even GTA V which I haven't played) it doesn't aim to be super realistic.

And now, onto a proper review:
Grand Theft Auto III has a dark and cold atmosphere, the story is quite interesting and throughout the game you make yourself more and more enemies (Triads, Mafia, Columbian Cartel). 
The dark atmopshere gets underlined by the amount of gangs cruising around Liberty City. The game itself is overly dark, Taxis are in a really dark tone of yellow, you can barely see colours of cars since they all seem almost black.
Like I said, this game hasa really dark atmosphere, and this is what makes the game better than Vice City or San Andreas.
Furthermore, this was the first ""3D"" GTA, so it was the beginning of a new era  the old top-down-camera is still available though).

The City is large for being the first 3D GTA game and not as alive as Vice City (Vice City only came out not even a year after GTA 3). The Radio is decent having Push it to the Limit otherwise there is only a few recognizeable songs. The Story isn't too great. Your character doesn't talk all he does is go to a person and get a job and then execute it. Not much more than that just rinse and repeat. The jobs range from Assassinations to picking up hookers and driving them to the local Police Ball. The Combat is something I want to touch on too. Not too great. The camera can be wonky at times and the shooting seems clunky (Much more improved in Vice City). There is side content to do. Like Taxi driving and Vigilante Missions though both aren't too interesting but at least they are there for people who like to do that kind of stuff. The Driving is practally the same throughout all the 3D GTA's so theres not much to say except the driving is good but not like a racer and it feels arcadey but fun (Considering it lasted 3 games each being a little more refinded). All in all GTA 3 is still a fantastic experience. Does it still hold up today? Not really depending on your playstyle and if you can deal with not too refined game mechanics and bugs and werid controls. 7.3/10.",1380183926,1385496286,True,3,0,0.502258837223052979,1,True,False,False,False,

There's a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action. 

While fun, the game doesn't hold up well against modern open-world games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isn't a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of in-game map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like I'm fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning you'll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. I'm hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.

About controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesn't recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra $10 on XPadder. It's still not great, but at least you'll be able to use all buttons.

I began to do the same with GTA3 senslessly going around committing a rampage. Then I started to delve into the story and it was then my appreciation for the series grew. As much the story was simple and some characters were bland, there were those characters which grew on you.

During the game, you fight your way up the crime ladder, killing pimps, dealers, and destroying gang operations throughout Liberty City, all the while, looking for the bitch that stabbed you in the back, and left you for dead in an alleyway.

The violence is golden, the freedom is liberating, and the fact that it's the first properly three-dimensional Grand Theft Auto game ever made, makes this beauty a shining example of the genre.

It took me a while to ""discover"" this game. Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.

GTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.

Today the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.

The game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up prostitutes to ""heal"" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the prostitute to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.

I do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.

This was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out. I have fond memories of my time spent in Liberty City.",1356466915,1356466915,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

The atmosphere and social commentary of (fictitious)1990's U.S. culture and media, delivered through the dialog, car radios and advertisements, is both accurate and controversial. The radio advertisements in particular are so over the top and funny but also disgustingly realistic. I loved the classical radio station in GTA III and wish that one will be in GTA IV.
For me, the unique thing that set GTA III apart from the GTA games that followed are the quirky and stylized look and physics. Some of the most fun I've had with GTA III was driving how you should never drive a car in real life.

Joystick support is terrible, it does not feature auto aim nor does the joysticks work properly. 

Orginality and an open world environment is what makes this boat sail. I thought the story was fairly alright.
